<img src="posts/carted_headshot.jpg" style="float: left; width: 230px; margin-right: 20px;"> Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Sayak Paul (à¦¸à¦¾à§Ÿà¦• à¦ªà¦¾à¦²). I work on [ðŸ§¨ diffusion models](https://hf.co/docs/diffusers) at [Hugging Face](https://hf.co). Know more about me from [here](https://sayak.dev/about). I maintain a Google Doc answering some FAQs at length. You can check it out [here](https://bit.ly/sayak-faqs). </img>

My external articles and other publishing engagements are listed [here](pages/authoring.qmd). Decks
from my speaking engagements are listed [here](pages/talksseminarsworkshops.qmd). A detailed account of the things that are not
directly available from the top navbar (interviews, talks etc.) can be found [here](pages/resources.qmd).

The structure of this website is inspired by [Omar's site](https://osanseviero.github.io/hackerllama/).
