Hi there 👋. I am Sayak Paul (সায়ক পাল). I work on [🧨 diffusion models](https://hf.co/docs/diffusers) at [Hugging Face](https://hf.co). Know more about me
from [here](https://sayak.dev/about). I maintain a Google Doc answering some FAQs at length. You can check it out [here](https://bit.ly/sayak-faqs). 

My external articles and other publishing engagements (like books, liveProjects, etc.) are listed [here](https://sayak.dev/authoring). Decks
from my speaking engagements are listed [here](https://sayak.dev/talksseminarsworkshops). [This page](pages/resources.qmd) gives you
a detailed account of the things that are not directly available from top navbar.

The structure of this website is inspired by [Omar's site](https://osanseviero.github.io/hackerllama/).
