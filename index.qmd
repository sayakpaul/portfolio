<img src="posts/carted_headshot.jpg" style="float: left; width: 230px; margin-right: 20px;"> Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Sayak Paul (à¦¸à¦¾à§Ÿà¦• à¦ªà¦¾à¦²). I work on [ðŸ§¨ diffusion models](https://hf.co/docs/diffusers) at [Hugging Face](https://hf.co). Know more about me from [here](https://sayak.dev/about). I maintain a Google Doc answering some FAQs at length. You can check it out [here](https://bit.ly/sayak-faqs). </img>

My external articles and other publishing engagements are listed [here](pages/authoring.qmd). Decks
from my speaking engagements are listed [here](pages/talksseminarsworkshops.qmd). A detailed account of the things that are not
directly available from the top navbar (interviews, talks etc.) can be found [here](pages/resources.qmd).

The structure of this website is inspired by [Omar's site](https://osanseviero.github.io/hackerllama/).

### News

- New work on few-step sampling of diffusion models [SANA-Sprint: One-Step Diffusion with Continuous-Time Consistency Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09641) with NVIDIA.
- New work: [From Reflection to Perfection: Scaling Inference-Time Optimization for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models via Reflection Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16080) with Le Zhuo, Liangbing Zhao, and others.
- New work: [Exploring the Deep Fusion of Large Language Models and Diffusion Transformers for Text-to-Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10046) with Bingda Tang, Boyang Zheng, Xichen Pan, and Saining Xie.
- Gave a talk at Stanford about DiTs. Find the slides here: [Transformers in Diffusion Models for Image Generation and Beyond](http://bit.ly/dit-cs25).
- Open-sourced [nanoDiT](https://github.com/sayakpaul/nanoDiT), an educational repository to show how to train class-conditional DiTs with rectified flow for image generation.
