Co-authored a book  [Hands-On Python Deep Learning for the Web](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.packtpub.com%2Fin%2Fdata%2Fhands-on-python-deep-learning-for-web&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFMYAvFS-WzTymOqO7XyzZtdmWV0Q)  with  [Anubhav Singh](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fxprilion.com&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNET_hwCDFMpPXSqwmzfw4HxevAq_A).

Authored the following liveProjects with [Manning](https://www.manning.com/):  
* [Use Machine Learning to Detect Phishing Websites](https://www.manning.com/liveproject/use-machine-learning-to-detect-phishing-websites?a_aid=pyimagesearch&a_bid=643ce05e) 
* [Summarize News Articles with NLP and TensorFlow](https://www.manning.com/liveproject/summarize-news-articles-with-nlp-and-tensorflow?a_aid=pyimagesearch&a_bid=643ce05e) (with [Souradip Chakraborty](https://www.linkedin.com/in/souradip-chakraborty/)) 

Authored two DataCamp Projects ([Predicting Credit Card Approvals](https://datacamp.pxf.io/doyrOM) and [Analyze International Debt Statistics](https://datacamp.pxf.io/MXKEAJ)) and a DataCamp Practice Pool on [Advanced Deep Learning with Keras](https://practice.datacamp.com/p/217?tap_a=5644-dce66f&tap_s=357540-5b28dd). 

Below are the blogs, articles, and tutorials I have written on Data Science, Machine Learning and more. I am fortunate enough 
to collaborate with  amazing folks from all around the globe. I am grateful to the [GDE Program](https://developers.google.com/programs/experts/)
(ML Developer Programs team) that provides me with Google Cloud Platform credits which I use to run various experiments for my own curiosity
and for blog posts.
