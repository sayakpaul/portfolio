    "In the [previous post](https://tulasi.dev/craft-in-tflite), we saw how to convert the pre-trained [CRAFT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.01941) model from PyTorch to TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) and run inference with the converted TFLite model. In this post, we will be comparing the TFLite variants of the CRAFT model to another text detection model - [EAST](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03155). The objective of this post is to provide a comparative study between these two models with respect to various deployment-specific pointers such as inference latency, model size, performance on dense text regions, and so on. Text detection continues to be a very important use-case across many verticals. So we hope this post will serve as a systematic guide for developers that are interested to explore on-device text detection models. \n",

We went beyond their task-specific performance and considered various essential factors that one needs to consider when deploying these models.
