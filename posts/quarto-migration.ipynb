When its creator, Hamel, [posted](https://forums.fast.ai/t/fastpages-deprecating-fastpages-in-favor-of-quarto/99095) about its deprecation in favor of Quarto, I was anxious. Migrations always make me anxious. But I still continued with fastpages anyway.\n",

In this post, I want to provide a detailed account of what I did and some personal preferential bits in the hope that it will be beneficial for someone else. Let's get started ðŸ’«"
