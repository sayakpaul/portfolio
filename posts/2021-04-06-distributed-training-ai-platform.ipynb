    "Jupyter Notebooks are a great way to present your code offering a good level of interactivity, transparency, and reproducibility.

    "If you are conducting large-scale training it is likely that you are using a powerful remote machine via SSH access. So, even if you are not using Jupyter Notebooks, problems like SSH pipe breakage, network teardown, etc. can easily occur. Consider using a powerful virtual machine on Cloud as your remote. The problem gets far worse when there’s a connection loss but you somehow forget to turn off that virtual machine to stop consuming its resources. You get billed for practically *nothing* when the breakdown happens until and unless you have set up some amount of alerts and fault tolerance.\n",

Our data loader is present here in [this script](https://github.com/sayakpaul/Distributed-Training-in-TensorFlow-2-with-AI-Platform/blob/main/trainer/data_loader.py).\n",

This strategy is applicable when we have a single host containing multiple GPUs. We will also be using [mixed-precision training](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/performance/mixed-precision-training/index.html) to speed up the process.

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "We have covered quite a lot of ground in this post. I hope by now you have an idea of how to combine tools like Docker, AI Platform to manage your large-scale training workflows in a more cost-effective and scalable way. As a next step, you could take the trained model from AI Platform and deploy the model using it. AI Platform [`predict` jobs](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/prediction/docs) make it easier to expose models via REST API-like services that are fully managed by AI Platform offering things like autoscaling, authorization, monitoring, etc. If you'd like to try it out yourself, I encourage you to check out the code of this post on [GitHub](https://github.com/sayakpaul/Distributed-Training-in-TensorFlow-2-with-AI-Platform). You are also welcome to checkout [TensorFlow Cloud](https://github.com/tensorflow/cloud) that provides a set of tools making it easier to perform large-scale training with GCP. "
