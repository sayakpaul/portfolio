    "Jupyter Notebooks are a great way to present your code offering a good level of interactivity, transparency, and reproducibility. However, operating with a Jupyter Notebook environment can get very challenging if you are working your way through large-scale training workflows as is common in deep learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are conducting large-scale training it is likely that you are using a powerful remote machine via SSH access. So, even if you are not using Jupyter Notebooks, problems like SSH pipe breakage, network teardown, etc. can easily occur. Consider using a powerful virtual machine on Cloud as your remote. The problem gets far worse when there’s a connection loss but you somehow forget to turn off that virtual machine to stop consuming its resources. You get billed for practically *nothing* when the breakdown happens until and unless you have set up some amount of alerts and fault tolerance.\n",

    "- A training workflow that is fully managed by a secure and reliable service with high availability. \n",
    "- The service should automatically provision and de-provision the resources we would ask it to configure allowing us to only get charged for what’s been truly consumed. \n",
    "- The service should also be very flexible. It must not introduce too much technical debt into our existing pipelines. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, we are going to consider all of these factors and will implement them using a service called [AI Platform](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform) (provided by GCP) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

For performance, we will also [prefetch](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/data_performance#prefetching) several future batches of data so that our model does not have to wait for the data to consume. Our data loader is present here in [this script](https://github.com/sayakpaul/Distributed-Training-in-TensorFlow-2-with-AI-Platform/blob/main/trainer/data_loader.py).\n",

    "- We will be training our model inside the [tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/MirroredStrategy) scope for distributed training. This strategy is applicable when we have a single host containing multiple GPUs. We will also be using [mixed-precision training](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/performance/mixed-precision-training/index.html) to speed up the process.

    "\n",
    "We have covered quite a lot of ground in this post. I hope by now you have an idea of how to combine tools like Docker, AI Platform to manage your large-scale training workflows in a more cost-effective and scalable way. As a next step, you could take the trained model from AI Platform and deploy the model using it. AI Platform [`predict` jobs](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/prediction/docs) make it easier to expose models via REST API-like services that are fully managed by AI Platform offering things like autoscaling, authorization, monitoring, etc. If you'd like to try it out yourself, I encourage you to check out the code of this post on [GitHub](https://github.com/sayakpaul/Distributed-Training-in-TensorFlow-2-with-AI-Platform). You are also welcome to checkout [TensorFlow Cloud](https://github.com/tensorflow/cloud) that provides a set of tools making it easier to perform large-scale training with GCP. "
