    "In this post, I discuss how I used several Google Cloud Platform (GCP) APIs to turn two ideas into small prototypes. It includes my thought process, the problems I ran into while developing the prototypes, and my approach toward tackling them. All the code discussed in the post is available in [<span class=\"underline\">this repository</span>](https://github.com/sayakpaul/GCP-ML-API-Demos).\n",
    "\n",
    "As a Machine Learning (ML) Practitioner, I advocate for having an understanding of the underlying principles of the models and other stuff that I use. This understanding has many extents. Sometimes, it involves minimally implementing models, and sometimes it may not involve the from-scratch implementation. When it does not involve the implementation part and when the model is readily available, I prefer to put such models directly to use and get a sense of their broader capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "With libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-Learn, realizing this usage has never been easier. As all of these libraries are open-source, you could easily get access to the low-level primitives of their model APIs whenever you’d like. It may require you to have a sufficient amount of experience with the library you’d use. But as a Machine Learning Practitioner, one cannot skip this practice. It’s important to have a good grip over a particular Machine Learning library given the domain of choice (structured tabular dataset, images, texts, audios, for example).\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, APIs that offer ML as a service, allow non-ML folks to incorporate the power of Machine Learning in their applications very easily. This way developers can prototype ideas faster than ever. Some would argue that [<span class=\"underline\">leaky abstractions</span>](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/) can hit sooner than expected and it can be particularly [<span class=\"underline\">very miserable in Machine Learning</span>](https://karpathy.github.io/2019/04/25/recipe/). Nonetheless, if you are more on the applied side of things and don’t want to worry about this aspect, that’s perfectly fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "I wanted to revisit this idea through the lens of an ML Practitioner. More precisely, I wanted to build a series of short demos utilizing the [<span class=\"underline\">Cloud ML APIs offered by Google Cloud Platform</span>](https://cloud.google.com/products/ai). The premise here is if I have an idea for an ML project, I wanted to see how quickly I can develop a [<span class=\"underline\">PoC</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_concept) around it."

As someone that is already working in the field of Computer Vision, I was inclined to do something that involves it. So here are some initial ideas that came to mind after spending a considerable amount of time with the different API documentation available on GCP:\n",

If you saw the [<span class=\"underline\">Text-to-Speech documentation</span>](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs), you probably noticed that it is really not a big deal.\n",
