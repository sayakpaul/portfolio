I work on diffusion models at [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co). My day-to-day includes contributing features to [ðŸ§¨ diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers), maintaining it, training and babysitting diffusion models, and sometimes muddying up the social media with emojis ðŸ˜‚. I am fortunate to have worked in different areas of machine learning (such as training and deploying BERT-sized language models[^1], scalable MLOps architectures[^2], model robustness[^3], etc.). For more details on my work experience, check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/sayakpaul) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sayak-paul/).

I run into ideas from time to time that need further looking around, experimentation, etc., which I like to refer to as "applied research". You can get an idea of what I mean by that from [this page](https://sayak.dev/research). I enjoy implementing research ideas, sometimes incorporating them into practical applications, and communicating my implementation details through [articles](https://sayak.dev/authoring/). I advocate for readable and self-contained code. I primarily use Python for programming. 

I have a flair for open-source initiatives. In particular, I have contributed to <a href="https://github.com/keras-team/keras/commits?author=sayakpaul"><font color="#d00000">Keras</font></a>, [KerasCV](https://github.com/keras-team/keras-cv/commits?author=sayakpaul), [ðŸ¤— Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/commits?author=sayakpaul), <a href="https://tfhub.dev/s?publisher=sayakpaul"><font color="#FF6F00">TensorFlow Hub</font></a>, <a href="https://github.com/keras-team/keras-io/commits?author=sayakpaul"><font color="#d00000">Keras Examples</font></a>, [TensorFlow Addons](https://git.io/JuUOr), and [Neural Structured Learning](https://git.io/JuUOd). From time to time, I also contribute to other Hugging Face libraries, such as [Accelerate](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate/commits?author=sayakpaul), [Optimum Quanto](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-quanto/commits?author=sayakpaul), and [PEFT](https://github.com/huggingface/peft/commits?author=sayakpaul). Thanks to my job, I get to do open-source full-time now! Off the work, I like writing technical articles, working on applied ML ideas, and speaking at conferences.

For my community contributions and innovative projects, the Intel Software Innovator Program recognized me as one of [their top innovators in 2019](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mzsy1q8jgkwj6cj/Intel_Top_Innovator_2019.jpg?dl=0). For my open-source contributions, I received the Google Open Source Peer Bonus Award in [2020](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2020/10/announcing-latest-google-open-source.html), [2021](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2021/09/announcing-latest-open-source-peer-bonus-winners.html), and [2022](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2022/09/announcing-the-second-group-of-open-source-peer-bonus-winners-in-2022.html), and [TensorFlow Top Contributor Award](https://blog.tensorflow.org/2021/11/2021-TF-Contributor-Awardees.html?linkId=8010214) in 2021. A detailed account of the awards and recognitions is available [here](https://sayak.dev/xyz/#awards-and-recognition).
