I am interested in the area of representation learning. More recently, I have developed an interest in diffusion models. 

Please refer to my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ecW-EE4AAAAJ&hl=en#) for details
on the publications I have been a part of. 

### Conference tutorials

- [Practical Adversarial Robustness in Deep Learning: Problems and Solutions](https://sites.google.com/view/par-2021) (CVPR'21)
- [Foundational Robustness of Foundation Models](https://sites.google.com/view/neurips2022-frfm-turotial/) (NeurIPS'22)
- [All Things ViTs: Understanding and Interpreting Attention in Vision](https://all-things-vits.github.io/atv/) (CVPR'23)
