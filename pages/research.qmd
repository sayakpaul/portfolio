I am interested in the area of representation learning. More recently, I have developed an interest in diffusion models (subjects include
alignment, test-time scaling, controlled generation). 

Please refer to my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ecW-EE4AAAAJ&hl=en#) for details
on the publications I have been a part of. 

### Conference tutorials
