    "text": "In the previous post, we saw how to convert the pre-trained CRAFT model from PyTorch to TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) and run inference with the converted TFLite model. In this post, we will be comparing the TFLite variants of the CRAFT model to another text detection model - EAST. The objective of this post is to provide a comparative study between these two models with respect to various deployment-specific pointers such as inference latency, model size, performance on dense text regions, and so on. Text detection continues to be a very important use-case across many verticals. So we hope this post will serve as a systematic guide for developers that are interested to explore on-device text detection models.\nPrecisely, we will be comparing the two models on the basis of the following pointers which we think are very crucial when it comes to deploying them out in the wild -"

We chose a mobile device for this purpose because text detection is a pretty prevalent recipe of many mobile applications such as Google Lens.\nIn order to make the comparisons fair, we consider the two models with three different image resolutions - 320x320, 640x416, and 1200x800. For each of these resolutions, we consider two different post-training quantization schemes - dynamic-range and float16. The CRAFT model conversion is not yet supported in the integer variant, hence we do not consider integer quantization (but the EAST model does support it)."

    "text": "Visual Inspection of Performance\nIn this setting, we run both of the models and their different variants (dynamic-range and float16 quantized) on a sample image that has dense text regions, and then we visualize the results. We observed that both of these models perform fairly well on images having lighter text regions. Here’s the sample image we used for the purpose -\n\n\nImage is taken from the SROIE dataset.\n\nTime to detect some texts!\n\nCRAFT - 320x320 Dynamic-Range & float16\nIn the dynamic-range quantization setting, we can see the model misses out on some text blocks.\n\n\nInference results from the 320x320 dynamic-range and float16 quantized CRAFT models.\n\nWith increased numerical precision i.e. float16, we can clearly see quite a bit of improvement in the results. It’s important to note that this improvement comes at the cost of increased model size.\nNext up, we apply the same steps to the EAST model.\n\n\nEAST - 320x320 Dynamic-Range & float16\nEAST apparently performs better than CRAFT under dynamic-range quantization. If we look closely, it appears that the CRAFT model produces far fewer overlaps in the detections compared to EAST. On the other hand, the EAST model is able to detect more text blocks. When developing practical applications with text detectors, it often becomes a classic case of precision-recall trade-offs like the one we are currently seeing. So, you would want to consider the application-specific needs in order to decide the level of trade-off to be achieved there.\n\n\nInference results from the 320x320 dynamic-range and float16 quantized EAST models.\n\nWith increased precision, the above-mentioned points still hold, i.e. the number of overlaps being way higher for the EAST model than they are in the CRAFT equivalent. In this setting (float16 quantization), superiority in the performance of the CRAFT model is quite evident in regards to the EAST model.\nAs different applications may use different image resolutions we decided to test the performance of the models on larger dimensions as well. This is what we are going to see next.\n\n\nCRAFT - 640x416 Dynamic-Range & float16\nOn an increased resolution, the CRAFT model performs pretty well -\n\n\nInference results from the 640x416 dynamic-range and float16 quantized CRAFT models.\n\nThe float16 version of this resolution is a slam dunk (rightfully leaving behind the barcode which is not a piece of text).\n\n\nEAST - 640x416 Dynamic-Range & float16\nThe performance of the EAST model under these settings are very equivalent to CRAFT -\n\n\nInference results from the 640x416 dynamic-range and float16 quantized EAST models.\n\nWith float16 quantization and 640x416 as the resolution, the CRAFT model is a clear winner. Notice that the EAST model is still unable to discard the barcode part which might be an important point to note for some applications.\nTime to inspect the results for our final and highest resolution - 1280x800.\n\n\nCRAFT - 1280x800 Dynamic-Range & float16\nUnder dynamic-range quantization, the results look okayish. The model misses out on a number of text blocks but the only ones that it detects appear to be neat.\n\n\nInference results from the 1280x800 dynamic-range and float16 quantized CRAFT models.\n\nThe results from the float16 variant are tremendous (as you probably have guessed by now).\n\n\nEAST - 1280x800 Dynamic-Range & float16\nAt this resolution, the EAST model seems to be performing well too -\n\n\nInference results from the 1280x800 dynamic-range and float16 quantized EAST models.\n\nWith float16 quantization as well, the CRAFT model beats EAST in terms of the detection quality."

Moreover, Playstore and AppStore also have size restrictions on the applications one can host there.\nOn the other hand, heavier models tend to be slower. If your application cannot have increased inference latency then you would want to have the model size as low as possible.\nThe following figure shows the size of the CRAFT and EAST models -\n\n\nModel (TFLite variants) sizes of CRAFT and EAST.\n\nThe dynamic-range quantized versions of both the models are in a well-acceptable range with respect to size.

Inference latency is also quite lower for all the variants of the EAST model compared to CRAFT. Earlier we saw how a quantization affects model performance under a particular resolution.

    "section": "",
    "text": "If you see the way deep learning research has progressed over the years, it has always been guided by the need of the hour. If I were to develop a chronology out of it, it would be something like - train better model -&gt; train them faster -&gt; get them good at generalizing well, and so on. With a stern increase in the demand for using deep learning more as just another technology stack, there could not have been a better time to think about how do we make our models infer faster. In this post, we are going to see how to use TensorRT to perform accelerated inference with TensorFlow (2) models. After all, making predictions with deep learning models is what makes you real 💰 and we would want to make sure that our bucks burned judiciously.\n\nmobilenet_v2 = tf.keras.applications.MobileNetV2(weights='imagenet')\nmobilenet_v2.save('mobilenet_v2')\n\nDownloading data from https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/keras-applications/mobilenet_v2/mobilenet_v2_weights_tf_dim_ordering_tf_kernels_1.0_224.h5\n14540800/14536120 [==============================] - 0s 0us/step\nWARNING:tensorflow:From /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/ops/resource_variable_ops.py:1817: calling BaseResourceVariable.__init__ (from tensorflow.python.ops.resource_variable_ops) with constraint is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.\nInstructions for updating:\nIf using Keras pass *_constraint arguments to layers.\nINFO:tensorflow:Assets written to: mobilenet_v2/assets\n\n\nHere, mobilenet_v2 is a directory and when you pass a directory to the save function, it serializes the model in the TensorFlow SavedModel format. This format makes it easier for us to be able to use it on different platforms - be it on GCP’s AI Platform, be it on TensorFlow JS, be it on TensorFlow Serving, and so on.\nNow, there are some basic preprocessing steps to be followed before we can actually feed an image to this model -\n\n# Prepare the image for prediction\nimg = tf.keras.preprocessing.image.load_img('elephant.jpg', target_size=(224, 224))\nx = tf.keras.preprocessing.image.img_to_array(img)\nx = np.expand_dims(x, axis=0)\nx = tf.keras.applications.mobilenet_v2.preprocess_input(x)\n\nHere’s how elephant.jpg looks like in case if anyone’s curious -\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, running the prediction and decoding it is just a matter of two lines of code -\n\n# Run inference\npreds = mobilenet_v2.predict(x)\nprint('Predicted:', tf.keras.applications.mobilenet_v2.decode_predictions(preds, top=3)[0])\n\nDownloading data from https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/data/imagenet_class_index.json\n40960/35363 [==================================] - 0s 0us/step\nPredicted: [('n02504013', 'Indian_elephant', 0.70024925), ('n01871265', 'tusker', 0.2549572), ('n02504458', 'African_elephant', 0.0033761878)]\n\n\nTo find out how much time does this model take to predict a given image? Let’s write a short utility function to handle that -\n\ndef time_my_model(model, data):\n    times = []\n    for i in range(20):\n        start_time = time.time()\n        one_prediction = model.predict(data)\n        delta = (time.time() - start_time)\n        times.append(delta)\n    mean_delta = np.array(times).mean()\n    fps = 1 / mean_delta\n    print('average(sec):{:.2f},fps:{:.2f}'.format(mean_delta, fps))\n\nIf we run time_my_model fives times the output would look like so -\n\n\naverage(sec):0.06,fps:15.48\naverage(sec):0.03,fps:32.26\naverage(sec):0.03,fps:32.48\naverage(sec):0.03,fps:31.14\naverage(sec):0.03,fps:31.67\n\n\nCan we further optimize this? We will start the next section with this question.\n\nOptimizing the pre-trained image classification model\nNote that explaining the different means of optimizing a deep learning model is out of the scop for this post. If you are interested, the following posts are great starting points -\n\nHigh performance inference with TensorRT Integration\nOptimizing TensorFlow Models for Serving\n\nLet’s now introduce the big elephant in the room - TensorRT. TensorRT is an SDK by NVIDIA for performing accelerated deep learning inference. It utilizes Tensor Cores of an NVIDIA GPU (for example V100, P4, etc.) and performs a number of model optimization steps for including parameter quantization, constant folding, model pruning, layer fusion, etc. You can know more about this SDK from here.\nNote that TensorRT will only be able to achieve acceleration when it’s used on supported hardware. For more on this, check out the aforementioned link.\nOptimizing the MobileNetV2 model is a three-step process -\n\nSetting up the optimization configuration -\n\nparams = trt.DEFAULT_TRT_CONVERSION_PARAMS._replace(\n    precision_mode='FP16',\n    is_dynamic_op=True)\nWe use the precision_mode argument to specify the numerical precision of the model parameters we would want. In this case it is FP16 (float16). is_dynamic_op argument is set to True so that the shapes would be determined during runtime. Onto the next step.\n(`trt` is aliased as `from tensorflow.python.compiler.tensorrt import trt_convert as trt`.)\n\nPerforming the model conversion for optimization -\nAs the headline suggests, in this step we actually perform the conversion with the configurations we specified in the previous step to optimize our model. python   converter = trt.TrtGraphConverterV2(       input_saved_model_dir='mobilenet_v2',       conversion_params=params)   converter.convert() For the conversion to take place, we are supplying the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model in the SavedModel format. It’s really nice to see how this format comes to unify different platforms.\nSerializing the optimized model -\nSerializing this optimized model is similar to how we did it for the pre-trained model - python   saved_model_dir_trt = 'mobilenet_v2.trt'   converter.save(saved_model_dir_trt)\n\nNow, how good is this new variant of the model? How accurate will it be? How much faster will it be? We will find those out in a moment. Before that let’s see how to run inference with this optimized model in the next section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe above code snippet won’t work in Colab or with any TensorFlow version that doesn’t ship a correctly compiled TensorRT (discussion). Therefore, it’s recommended to use an NVIDIA Docker container for this purpose. This resource can be useful in this regard.\n\n\n\n\nRunning inference with the optimized model\nTensorFlow 2.x provides a convenient function tf.saved_model.load to load the models saved in SavedModel. We are only interested in performing inference with the model so we will load the respective signature from the model as a concrete function -\n\n# Load the particular signature from the TRT graph\nroot = tf.saved_model.load(saved_model_dir_trt)\nconcrete_func = root.signatures['serving_default']\n\nYou can inspect the structure of this function by running concrete_func.structured_outputs and the output would be -\n\n\n{'predictions': TensorSpec(shape=(None, 1000), dtype=tf.float32, name='predictions')}\n\n\nAs we would expect, this function will yield a 1000-d vector which is nothing but probabilities distributed across the 1000 different classes of the ImageNet dataset. Also note the key of the above dictionary, it might not be ‘Logits’ always.\nNow, to be able to run the inference and decode them in a human-interpretable way, we first need to get the ImageNet dataset labels -\n\n# Gather the ImageNet labels first and prepare them\nlabels_path = tf.keras.utils.get_file('ImageNetLabels.txt', 'https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/data/ImageNetLabels.txt')\nimagenet_labels = np.array(open(labels_path).read().splitlines())\n\nTime for performing the inference -\n\n# Perform inference\nlabeling = concrete_func(tf.constant(x.astype('float32')))\nactivations = tf.nn.softmax(labeling['predictions'])\nimagenet_labels[np.argsort(activations)[0,::-1][:5]+1]\n\narray(['Indian elephant', 'tusker', 'African elephant', 'bull mastiff',\n       'Great Dane'], dtype='&lt;U30')\n\n\nLooks like our optimized model got it right!\nWhile parsing the predictions, we would need to put focus on the key in this case which is ‘predictions’.\n\n\nBattle of performance\nLet’s first recall where we were with our pre-trained MobileNetV2 -\naverage(sec):0.03,fps:37.22\naverage(sec):0.03,fps:36.54\naverage(sec):0.03,fps:36.54\naverage(sec):0.03,fps:38.93\naverage(sec):0.03,fps:37.24\nNow, to time the performance of our optimized model, we will need to make little adjustments to the utility function we previously wrote. This is mainly because now, we will now be using a concrete function which takes a tf.constant.\n\ndef time_trt_model():\n    image_input = tf.constant(x.astype('float32'))\n    times = []\n    for i in range(20):\n        start_time = time.time()\n        one_prediction = concrete_func(input_1=image_input)\n        delta = (time.time() - start_time)\n        times.append(delta)\n    mean_delta = np.array(times).mean()\n    fps = 1 / mean_delta\n    print('average(sec):{:.2f},fps:{:.2f}'.format(mean_delta, fps))\n\nFor convenience, here’s our x -\nimg = tf.keras.preprocessing.image.load_img('elephant.jpg', target_size=(224, 224))\nx = tf.keras.preprocessing.image.img_to_array(img)\nx = np.expand_dims(x, axis=0)\nx = tf.keras.applications.mobilenet_v2.preprocess_input(x)\nLet’s now run time_trt_model() for five times -\n\n\naverage(sec):0.00,fps:227.01\naverage(sec):0.00,fps:279.10\naverage(sec):0.00,fps:269.89\naverage(sec):0.00,fps:277.14\naverage(sec):0.00,fps:219.98\n\n\nThat’s quite a bit of improvement, isn’t it? Note that you may observe slower inference in your first call to time_trt_model(). It may happen because of the additional time a GPU takes to set itself up. When running comparisons like this, it’s a good practice to first warm up the base hardware by running a few test iterations on it and then run the actual iterations for comparison. Depending on the GPU you’re using, these numbers can vary (these experiments were performed a Tesla P100).\nTalking about the memory footprints of both the models, for the pre-trained model we have -\n\n# Size of the model files\n!du --all -h mobilenet_v2\n\n96K mobilenet_v2/variables/variables.data-00000-of-00002\n14M mobilenet_v2/variables/variables.data-00001-of-00002\n20K mobilenet_v2/variables/variables.index\n14M mobilenet_v2/variables\n3.9M    mobilenet_v2/saved_model.pb\n4.0K    mobilenet_v2/assets\n18M mobilenet_v2\n\n\nWe have a total of 18 MB here. For the optimized model, we have -\n\n!du --all -h mobilenet_v2.trt\n\n96K mobilenet_v2.trt/variables/variables.data-00000-of-00002\n14M mobilenet_v2.trt/variables/variables.data-00001-of-00002\n20K mobilenet_v2.trt/variables/variables.index\n14M mobilenet_v2.trt/variables\n31M mobilenet_v2.trt/saved_model.pb\n4.0K    mobilenet_v2.trt/assets\n45M mobilenet_v2.trt\n\n\nWoah! The size has increased in this case! This is because the computational graph of our optimized model has been changed. However, the size of the parameters (mobilenet_v2/variables and mobilenet_v2.trt/variables) of both models is the same.\nIn real-life situations, as a machine learning practitioner, you will often have to make trade-offs between memory footprints, performance both in terms of accuracy and inference time. So having the knowledge of employing the right tools at the right moment will help you a long way. So, if you are looking for reducing the memory footprint of the model as well as accelerating the inference time, TensorFlow Lite is a good choice. In the bonus section of the post, we are going to discuss it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nTensorFlow has now introduced a tf.experimental.tensorrt.Converter API with better support for TensorRT.\n\n\n\n\nUsing TensorRT on your custom models\nThis section is for you to pick up. It will be a nice weekend project to train a simple model on a custom dataset and compare the performances as we saw in this post. Additionally, it will be interesting to compare different evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall for the different models (a custom trained mode, its optimized variants). We barely scratched the surface of TensorRT in this post. You are encouraged to experiment with the different arguments that come with the functions we saw in the post and figure out what works the best for your use-case. If your use-case involves embedded devices and mobile phones then TensorFlow Lite will be another great framework for you to explore."

In SimCLR, the positive pairs are generated by taking different views of the same image and the negative pairs are then randomly sampled from the other images present in a batch.\n\nHere are some examples of negative pairs -\n\nAs discussed in the Supervised Contrastive Learning paper, this method of contrasting two different views of the same image can result in false negatives i.e. the samples belonging to the same class might get mapped differently in the embedding space. There’s no way for us to properly mitigate this issue without having access to the original labels. Hence, I mentioned if you have loads of labeled images, it’s better to use Supervised Contrastive Learning to capture meaningful representations.\n\nSupervised Contrastive Learning extends how we train supervised models by introducing a two stage training framework. In the first stage, it uses the label information in the contrastive loss to learn to map the encoded representations effectively. In the second stage, it train a linear model on top of these encoded representations for the given supervised training objective.\nIn practice this works quite well -\n\nYou might be feeling very tempted to try out this on your labeled dataset. Truth be told - Supervised Contrastive Learning is also compute-intensive even for relatively small datasets. So, if you don’t have the training budget you might need to reconsider this option.\nMaybe you have a relatively smaller labeled dataset and you just want to be able to fine-tune a good enough architecture which is still very useful for many practical scenarios.

Its flexible API design is really to follow and it makes it easier to work with custom image datasets by providing meaningful high-level abstractions.\nWe instantiate the ImageDataGenerator class like so -\n\nimg_gen = tf.keras.preprocessing.image.ImageDataGenerator(\n    rescale=1./255,\n    rotation_range=30,\n    horizontal_flip=True)\n\nWe specify two augmentation operations and a pixel rescaling operation in there. ImageDataGenerator comes with a handy flow_from_directory method that allows us to read images from a directory and apply the specified operations on the fly during the time of training. Here’s how to instruct the img_gen object to read images from a directory -\n\nIMG_SHAPE = 224\nBATCH_SIZE = 32\n\nimg_flow = img_gen.flow_from_directory(flowers, \n    shuffle=True, \n    batch_size=BATCH_SIZE,\n    target_size=(IMG_SHAPE, IMG_SHAPE))\n\nFound 3670 images belonging to 5 classes.\n\n\nWe then verify the images and the labels and they are indeed parsed right -\n\nimages, labels = next(img_flow)\nprint(images.shape, labels.shape)\nshow_batch(images, labels)\n\n(32, 224, 224, 3) (32, 5)\n\n\n\n\n\nTraining with an ImageDataGenerator instance is extremely straight-forward -\nmodel = get_training_model()\nmodel.fit(img_flow, ...)\nFor a fully worked out example, refer to this tutorial.\nAs can be seen in this blog post, ImageDataGenerator’s overall data loading performance can have a significant effect on how fast your model trains. To tackle situations, where you need to maximize the hardware utilization without burning unnecessary bucks, TensorFlow’s data module can be really helpful (comes at some costs).\n\n\nTensorFlow image ops with tf.data APIs\nThe blog post I mentioned in the previous section shows the kind of performance boost achievable with tf.data APIs. But it’s important to note that boost comes at the cost of writing boilerplate code which makes the overall process more involved. For example, here’s how you would load and preprocess your images and labels -\n\ndef parse_images(image_path):\n    # Load and preprocess the image\n    img = tf.io.read_file(image_path) # read the raw image\n    img = tf.image.decode_jpeg(img, channels=3) # decode the image back to proper format\n    img = tf.image.convert_image_dtype(img, tf.float32) # scale the pixel values to [0, 1] \n    img = tf.image.resize(img, [IMG_SHAPE, IMG_SHAPE]) # resize the image\n\n    # Parse the labels\n    label = tf.strings.split(image_path, os.path.sep)[5]\n\n    return (img, label)\n\nYou would then write a separate augmentation policy with the TensorFlow Image ops -\n\ndef augment(image, label):\n    img = tf.image.rot90(image)\n    img = tf.image.flip_left_right(img)\n    return (img, label)\n\nTo chain the above two together you would first create an initial dataset consisting of only the image paths -\n\nimage_paths = list(paths.list_images(flowers))\nlist_ds = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((image_paths))\n\nNow, you would read, preprocess, shuffle, augment, and batch your dataset -\n\nAUTO = tf.data.experimental.AUTOTUNE\n\ntrain_ds = (\n    list_ds\n    .map(parse_images, num_parallel_calls=AUTO)\n    .shuffle(1024)\n    .map(augment, num_parallel_calls=AUTO) # augmentation call\n    .batch(BATCH_SIZE)\n    .prefetch(AUTO)\n)\n\nnum_parallel_calls allows you to parallelize the mapping function and tf.data.experimental.AUTOTUNE lets TensorFlow decide the level of parallelism to use dynamically (how cool is that?). prefetch allows loading in the next batch of data well before your model finishes the current epoch of training. It is evident that this process is more involved than the previous one.\nVerifying if we constructed the data input pipeline correctly is a vital step before you feed your data to the model -\n\nimage_batch, label_batch = next(iter(train_ds))\nprint(image_batch.shape, label_batch.shape)\nshow_batch(image_batch.numpy(), label_batch.numpy(), image_data_gen=False)\n\n(32, 224, 224, 3) (32,)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe “b”s appear before the class labels because TensorFlow parses the strings as byte-strings. Using train_ds with your model is also just about executing -\nmodel = get_training_model()\nmodel.fit(train_ds, ...)\nHere you can find a fully worked out example. Here you can know more about the different performance considerations when using tf.data. There are more image ops available with TensorFlow Addons which can found here.\nRecently, Keras introduced image_dataset_from_directory function (only available in tf-nightly at the time of writing this) which takes care of many of the boilerplate code we saw above and still yields pretty good performance. Here’s a tutorial that shows how to use it.\nKeras has also introduced a number of image processing layers which can be very useful to build flexible augmentation pipelines using the Sequential API. In the next section, let’s see how.\n\n\nUsing Keras’s (experimental) image processing layers\nJust like you would construct an entire model using the Sequential API, you can now construct very flexible data augmentation pipelines using the newly introduced (although experimental at the time of writing this) image processing layers. If we were to convert the data augmentation operations we have been following in the tutorial so far, building a data augmentation pipeline using this approach would be like so -\n\ndata_augmentation = tf.keras.Sequential([\n    tf.keras.layers.experimental.preprocessing.RandomFlip('horizontal'),\n    tf.keras.layers.experimental.preprocessing.RandomRotation(0.3)\n])\n\nBefore passing your data through this stack of layers makes sure you haven’t applied any augmentation already. So, it’s safe to create a separate TensorFlow dataset without mapping the augmentation function like we previously did -\n\n# Create TensorFlow dataset without any augmentation\ntrain_ds = (\n    list_ds\n    .map(parse_images, num_parallel_calls=AUTO)\n    .shuffle(1024)\n    .batch(BATCH_SIZE)\n    .prefetch(AUTO)\n)\n\nNow, we can see how to examine some of the augmented images that would come out of this mini pipeline -\n\nimage_batch, label_batch = next(iter(train_ds))\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 10))\nfor n in range(25):\n    ax = plt.subplot(5, 5, n+1)\n    augmented_image = data_augmentation(tf.expand_dims(image_batch[n], 0))\n    plt.imshow(augmented_image[0].numpy())\n    plt.title(label_batch[n].numpy().decode(\"utf-8\"))\n    plt.axis('off')\n\n\n\n\nWe can also make use of Python lambdas to map data_augmentation directly to our tf.data pipeline like so:\ntrain_ds = (\n    list_ds\n    .map(parse_images, num_parallel_calls=AUTO)\n    .shuffle(1024)\n    .batch(BATCH_SIZE)\n    .map(lambda x, y: (data_augmentation(x), y),\n        num_parallel_calls=AUTO)\n    .prefetch(AUTO)\n)\nNote that these layers can be also added as a part of your model allowing them to run on GPUs. Based on your compute budget you should decide if you would want to run these layers on the GPU or you would rather have them executed separately on the CPU.\nA functional model definition in Keras using this approach may look like so -\n# You define an input layer with pre-defined shapes\ninputs = keras.Input(shape=(IMG_SHAPE, IMG_SHAPE, 3))\n\nx = data_augmentation(inputs)  # Apply random data augmentation\nx = feature_extractor_model(x, training=False)\nx = GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)\nx = Dropout(0.2)(x)  \noutputs = Dense(1)(x)\n\nmodel = Model(inputs, outputs)\nNow, model should be good to go with - model.fit(train_ds, ...). A fully worked out example is available here. Note that, performance might get slightly affected when going with this approach since the GPUs will be utilized to run the preprocessing layers as well.\nLet’s now think about situations where we may need to use a combination of the image ops of TensorFlow and the layers we just saw. What if we need to plug in custom augmentation operations in the augmentation pipeline? Added on top of it, what if we need to fix the probability at which the augmentation operations would get applied? Data augmentation pipelines are quite central behind the success of recent works like SimCLR, Augmix, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThese layers have pre-defined inference-time behaviour. So even if you have included them inside your model itself, it’s totally fine. But if you want them during inference, you would need to set its inference-time behaviour.\n\n\n\n\nTowards more complex augmentation pipelines\nIn this final approach, we will see how to mix and match between the different stock image ops, and stock image processing layers. Let’s first define a class utilizing the stock image ops with a utility function to apply them at random with a pre-defined probability.\n\nclass CustomAugment(object):\n    def __call__(self, image):        \n        # Random flips and grayscale with some stochasticity\n        img = self._random_apply(tf.image.flip_left_right, image, p=0.6)\n        img = self._random_apply(self._color_drop, img, p=0.9)\n        return img\n\n    def _color_drop(self, x):\n        image = tf.image.rgb_to_grayscale(x)\n        image = tf.tile(x, [1, 1, 1, 3])\n        return x\n    \n    def _random_apply(self, func, x, p):\n        return tf.cond(\n          tf.less(tf.random.uniform([], minval=0, maxval=1, dtype=tf.float32),\n                  tf.cast(p, tf.float32)),\n          lambda: func(x),\n          lambda: x)\n\n_random_apply is taken from the official SimCLR repository. Now, in order to tie it together with the stock image processing layers, we can still use the Sequential API with a Lambda layer -\n\n# Build the augmentation pipeline\ndata_augmentation = tf.keras.Sequential([\n    tf.keras.layers.Lambda(CustomAugment()),\n    tf.keras.layers.experimental.preprocessing.RandomRotation(0.1)\n])\n\nWhen we verify if it’s indeed correct, we get desired outputs -\n\nimage_batch, label_batch = next(iter(train_ds))\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 10))\nfor n in range(25):\n    ax = plt.subplot(5, 5, n+1)\n    augmented_image = data_augmentation(tf.expand_dims(image_batch[n], 0))\n    plt.imshow(augmented_image[0].numpy())\n    plt.title(label_batch[n].numpy().decode(\"utf-8\"))\n    plt.axis('off')\n\n\n\n\nTraining models when using this approach remains the same as the previous one. Keep in mind that performance can get affected when using this approach.\n\n\nReferences\n\nFine-tuning with Keras and Deep Learning\nTransfer learning & fine-tuning\nImage classification from scratch\nData augmentation"

I find it incredibly helpful in boosting my confidence.

    "section": "Learn, Apply, (Demo), Repeat",
    "text": "Learn, Apply, (Demo), Repeat\nLearning is not enough. You need to be able to develop evidence that shows you can apply what you’ve learned successfully. I highly recommend reading this interview with Emil Wallner who’s an “internet-taught” ML Researcher working as a resident at Google.\nBelow, I discuss a few things you can do to exercise your ML learnings.\n\nKaggle\nKaggle is arguably one of the best platforms to develop skills for data preprocessing and applying ML in creative ways to solve unique problems. So, pick an interesting dataset or a competition just for learning purposes. Putting the competitive mindset aside, during my initial years it really helped me to develop a mindset of always learning to facilitate self-improvement. If you commit to it hard enough, you will have developed a bunch of useful skills. Over time, you’ll definitely get better.\nKeeping an open mind for learning is important here because expectations of outcomes can quickly derail you. Also, remember that the rate of improvement is not the same for everyone. So, it’s better to just do things that are within your control (for example, learning something), and consistently get better at those.\n\n\nPapers / Concepts\nReading research papers is a common undertaking in ML. It can be rewarding to summarize, implement, and blog about a paper that is impactful and tackles interesting problems. Extending on this theme, you have a number of options:\n\nYou can summarize a paper in your own words and publish it on platforms like Medium or even on your own blog. It’s also important to get feedback on your work. So, feel free to share your work on Social Media as well as let the authors of the actual paper know about your work. A paper summary is supposed to be a reflection of how you perceived the paper. So, if you have criticisms of a paper, do include those with solid reasoning. If you’re looking for an example, definitely check out Aakash Kumar Nain’s paper summaries.\nPicking a paper could be a non-trivial work especially when there’s always a flood of papers on arXiv. I usually follow the blogs of research labs at Google, Meta, AI2, BAIR, etc., to keep myself up-to-date about the work I care about. There’s a good chance you’ll find your niche there. Following the works of the most accomplished researchers from my favorite domains is another practice I incorporate.\nIn this regard, I highly recommend the following two books that actively cite examples of relevant research papers and also implement them in ways that are practically beneficial: Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch by Jeremy Howard and Sylvain Gugger, Natural Language Processing with Transformers by Lewis Tunstall, Leandro von Werra, and Thomas Wolf. For developing a general understanding of different areas in ML, I recommend the articles on Distill Pub. \nNowadays, a majority of ML papers come with official open-source implementations in the interest of reproducibility. But some don’t. Regardless of either, it’s a good exercise to try to implement the novel bits of a paper. The timmlibary is a great example of how paper reimplementations should be structured. \nBlogging has easily become one of the most effective ways to communicate your understanding of something. This does not need to be just tied to papers, though. You can always pick up an interesting concept and blog about it. Many ML stalwarts keep pressing on why you should blog and here is one such example: Why you (yes, you) should blog by Rachel Thomas.\n\nYou can also consider making videos on papers, concepts, and so on. If you haven’t already, then definitely get to know Yannic Kilcher who has revolutionized the way forward in this theme.\n\n\nOpen-source Contributions\nFrom my personal experience, I can confirm that making open-source contributions is one of the most useful ways to stay involved in the domain. All the popular ML Python libraries (Scikit-Learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, JAX, Hugging Face Transformers, etc.) are open-source and that provides even more opportunities to learn and grow.\nI have a separate presentation on this topic but here, I provide my perspectives for context:\n\nWhen you’re contributing to a well-maintained open-source library for the first time there’s a high chance that you’ll learn a few things other than just ML. These include writing unit tests, setting up the local development environment, library building tools, etc. This way, you get first-hand exposure to how software engineering is approached in the ML domain in general.\nSo, not only do you get to contribute to your favorite open-source library (which is an inexplicable feeling anyway), but you also get to learn skills that are practically quite demanding. Beyond these, you get a chance to interact with experts and get their feedback to improve your work. Additionally, you get to collect objective evidence of your skills - coding, thorough understanding of a critical component and the library, building a library, etc. - all of which are noteworthy.\nNote that you’re not alone if you’re feeling lost when you’re just starting to contribute to an open-source library. It happens to most. But when you put your mind toward making your contribution anyway, you get to get better in the process. \nIf you feel you’re not ready yet to make contributions, working on your own open-source projects is another promising avenue to pursue. Take Andrej Karpathy’s miniGPT project as an example. Besides being an amazing educational resource for learning about the GPT model, it serves as a great reference for implementing many of the foundational blocks of Transformer-based architectures.\nIf you’re looking for open-source project ideas then my presentation on this topic might be helpful.\n\nNow that we’ve looked into different ways of being engaged with our independent ML practice, let us take examples of two individuals from the ML community who have followed similar paths in this regard."

    "text": "Taking it a step further with concrete functions and SavedModel\nThe SavedModel format is the standard serialization format in TensorFlow 2.x since it communicates very well with the entire TensorFlow ecosystem. Be it GCP AI Platform, be it tf.keras, be it TFLite, etc,, SavedModel format unifies the entire ecosystem. For serializing custom models (developed using subclassing) SavedModel would be needed as well.\nIn this section, let’s see how can we do the same i.e. embed a preprocessing function inside a model so that it can be serialized in the SavedModel format.\n\nStep 1: Create a sequential model without any preprocessing layer\n\ndef get_training_model_v2():\n    # Construct the model using the Functional API\n    input_layer = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(28, 28), name=\"input_layer\")\n    flatten = tf.keras.layers.Flatten()(input_layer)\n    dense_1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation=\"relu\")(flatten)\n    dropout = tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.2)(dense_1)\n    outputs = tf.keras.layers.Dense(len(CLASSES), activation=\"softmax\")(dropout)\n\n    # Create the model\n    model = tf.keras.models.Model(input_layer, outputs)\n\n    # Compile the model and return it\n    model.compile(optimizer=\"adam\",\n                loss=\"sparse_categorical_crossentropy\",\n                metrics=[\"accuracy\"])\n        \n    return model\n\n\n\nStep 2: Train it!\n\n# Train the model for 10 epochs\napparel_model_v2 = get_training_model_v2()\nhistory = apparel_model_v2.fit(x_train, y_train, \n    validation_data=(x_test, y_test), \n    epochs=10, \n    batch_size=128)\n\nEpoch 1/10\n469/469 [==============================] - 2s 4ms/step - loss: 0.5995 - accuracy: 0.7914 - val_loss: 0.4549 - val_accuracy: 0.8347\nEpoch 2/10\n469/469 [==============================] - 2s 4ms/step - loss: 0.4200 - accuracy: 0.8501 - val_loss: 0.4094 - val_accuracy: 0.8520\nEpoch 3/10\n469/469 [==============================] - 2s 4ms/step - loss: 0.3823 - accuracy: 0.8616 - val_loss: 0.3831 - val_accuracy: 0.8635\nEpoch 4/10\n469/469 [==============================] - 2s 4ms/step - loss: 0.3575 - accuracy: 0.8713 - val_loss: 0.3896 - val_accuracy: 0.8563\nEpoch 5/10\n469/469 [==============================] - 2s 4ms/step - loss: 0.3405 - accuracy: 0.8758 - val_loss: 0.3569 - val_accuracy: 0.8720\nEpoch 6/10\n469/469 [==============================] - 2s 4ms/step - loss: 0.3249 - accuracy: 0.8813 - val_loss: 0.3490 - val_accuracy: 0.8733\nEpoch 7/10\n469/469 [==============================] - 2s 4ms/step - loss: 0.3176 - accuracy: 0.8840 - val_loss: 0.3480 - val_accuracy: 0.8735\nEpoch 8/10\n469/469 [==============================] - 2s 4ms/step - loss: 0.3055 - accuracy: 0.8878 - val_loss: 0.3355 - val_accuracy: 0.8809\nEpoch 9/10\n469/469 [==============================] - 2s 4ms/step - loss: 0.2971 - accuracy: 0.8914 - val_loss: 0.3331 - val_accuracy: 0.8792\nEpoch 10/10\n469/469 [==============================] - 2s 4ms/step - loss: 0.2905 - accuracy: 0.8920 - val_loss: 0.3344 - val_accuracy: 0.8808\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: SavedModel plunge\nOkay! Now we are ready to the crux of the section. We will first create a custom model class (inherited from tf.keras.Model) and it will contain two things: - A model that is loaded with the weights of a trained model - A serving function that will contain the preprocessing function along with the necessary signature.\n\n# A custom class for serving\nclass ExportModel(tf.keras.Model):\n    def __init__(self, model):\n        super().__init__(self)\n        self.model = model\n\n    @tf.function(input_signature=[tf.TensorSpec([None, 28, 28], dtype=tf.uint8)])\n    def my_serve(self, images):\n        images = tf.cast(images, tf.float32) / 255        # pre-processing\n        probabilities = self.model(images)                # prediction from model\n        class_index = tf.argmax(probabilities, axis=-1)   # post-processing\n        return {\"class_index\": class_index}\n\nmy_serve is our serving function. You can see that is decorated with tf.function and the reason behind doing so is it allows us to embed an arbitrary function in a model’s graph which can later be exported using the SavedModel format.\nWe can also see - input_signature=[tf.TensorSpec([None, 28, 28], dtype=tf.uint8)]. This is needed in order to indicate which part of the model’s graph would be needed while serving. By specifying tf.TensorSpec([None, 28, 28], we instruct the function that the inputs should respect this shape - [None, 28, 28] and the dtype argument is self-explanatory.\nWe will get to why the return type of the function is done in such a way - {\"class_index\": class_index} in a moment.\nIf you are interested to know more using SavedModel and different serialization options that come with it, be sure to check this tutorial out.\n\n\nStep 4: Instantiate a dummy model and set its weights\n\n# Set the weights of this dummy model to the weights of the model we trained\nrestored_model = get_training_model_v2()\nrestored_model.set_weights(apparel_model_v2.get_weights()) \n\n\n\nStep 5: Export the model and run inference\nNow, to serialize the model in the SavedModel format we will make use of tf.saved_model.save. It can automatically determine which input signature to use for serving for most of the models if the details are available. However, in our case, it won’t be able to do so. So, we will need to explicitly indicate which function to use as the signature while serving.\n\nexport_path = \"/content/saved_model/1/\"\ntf.keras.backend.set_learning_phase(0) # Make sure no weight update happens\nserving_model = ExportModel(restored_model) # Instantiate a model with the preprocessing function\ntf.saved_model.save(serving_model, export_path, signatures={'serving_default': serving_model.my_serve})\n\nWARNING:tensorflow:Skipping full serialization of Keras layer &lt;__main__.ExportModel object at 0x7f4096b7b358&gt;, because it is not built.\nWARNING:tensorflow:From /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/ops/resource_variable_ops.py:1817: calling BaseResourceVariable.__init__ (from tensorflow.python.ops.resource_variable_ops) with constraint is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.\nInstructions for updating:\nIf using Keras pass *_constraint arguments to layers.\nINFO:tensorflow:Assets written to: /content/saved_model/1/assets\n\n\nBy specifying 'serving_default': serving_model.my_serve we instructed tf.saved_model.save about which signature to use for serving. Now if we inspect what all were saved, things should seem consistent. For this we are going to use the saved_model_cli command-line interpreter.\n\n!saved_model_cli show --dir /content/saved_model/1 --tag_set serve --signature_def serving_default\n\nThe given SavedModel SignatureDef contains the following input(s):\n  inputs['images'] tensor_info:\n      dtype: DT_UINT8\n      shape: (-1, 28, 28)\n      name: serving_default_images:0\nThe given SavedModel SignatureDef contains the following output(s):\n  outputs['class_index'] tensor_info:\n      dtype: DT_INT64\n      shape: (-1)\n      name: StatefulPartitionedCall:0\nMethod name is: tensorflow/serving/predict\n\n\nSo, we can see that the configuration that is expected from the inputs and the outputs of the serialized model is consistent with what we had instructed. We returned the outputs in form a dictionary (namely class_index) in my_serve and we can see that as well.\nWe can also do the inspection in Pythonic ways.\n\nloaded = tf.saved_model.load(\"/content/saved_model/1/\")\nprint(list(loaded.signatures.keys())) # This signature will be used while serving\n\n['serving_default']\n\n\n\n# Output configuration\ninfer = loaded.signatures[\"serving_default\"]\nprint(infer.structured_outputs)\n\n{'class_index': TensorSpec(shape=(None,), dtype=tf.int64, name='class_index')}\n\n\nLet’s finally run the inference!\n\n# Load the sample image\nimage_pixels = cv2.imread(\"sample_image.png\")\nimage_pixels = cv2.cvtColor(image_pixels, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)\n\n\n# Run inference\nCLASSES[infer(tf.constant(image_pixels))[\"class_index\"].numpy()[0]]\n\n'Ankle boot'\n\n\nWe can see that the prediction is correct in this case as well. So, when we ran infer = loaded.signatures[\"serving_default\"] we essentially loaded a concrete function i.e. we loaded my_serve. Remember we assigned the value of serving_default in the beginning of this section?\nWith infer(tf.constant(image_pixels)) we are simply running our input image through the concrete function and we are parsing the output from the dictionary (class_index being the key) it returns ."

    "section": "How should I get started?",
    "text": "How should I get started?\nFirst and foremost, it’s important to acknowledge that GSoC requires some amount of open-source experience beforehand. That not only makes your application stronger but also sets you up for the program itself. But beyond everything else, having a genuine passion for contributing to open-source is important and is a key enabling factor. Open-source should be a fun engagement driven by your passion for helping a community. So, ensure you’re chasing the right things.\n\nUnderstand what GSoC is, how it works, what are the rules, and study some projects from the previous years by going to GSoC’s official website: ​​https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/.\nHere’s another resource that might be equally helpful. It’s important that you set your expectations right from the very beginning. Sometimes having conversations with the past GSoC contributors is really helpful in this regard. \nTake a look at the organizations taking part in GSoC. You’ll notice that they have all their projects listed for which they are welcoming contributions. \nStudy all the official resources that are out there for the project you want to contribute to. You may be interested in multiple projects but it helps to laser focus on one so that you can precisely figure out what components you’d want to work on, your timeline, etc. \nGet started contributing. Here are some good examples that make it clear what a GSoC contributor should do first:\n\nArduPilot\nGNOME\nPerformance Co-Pilot\nRoboComp\nWikimedia Foundation \n\nSometimes a project may not require having prior contribution experience but having it is almost always better. TensorFlow Hub (TF-Hub) is one such example where you’re generally asked to code a ML model, (optionally) train it, and host the model on TF-Hub thereby making it easier for the community to use the model. \nLastly, if you haven’t worked with a version control system before definitely spend time doing that. Git is a good example of such a system and here’s a good course from Udacity that can be helpful."

    "section": "What makes a proposal great?",
    "text": "What makes a proposal great?\nFirstly, I’d like to acknowledge that the answers to this question should be subjective. That said, I think there are certain common aspects that are shared by all great GSoC proposals.\n\nGSoC is about building things. So including your experience that reflects the same immediately catches the eye. You build that experience over a period of time, it’s not something built overnight. That way, your experience speaks about a few things: consistency, technical depth, punctuality, communication, etc. Let me provide some examples.  Say, you wanted to contribute to KerasCV by adding a new layer(s) to it. If you can show that you’ve already worked on something that reflects the experience relevant to the contribution, it puts you in a better position than someone without that experience.\nSimilarly, if you wanted to contribute a model to TF-Hub, it helps to show that you’ve experience implementing models and relevant things such as layers, blocks, etc. \nWhen you’re talking about an experience in your proposal be sure to back it with verifiable links. Without that, the mention becomes practically void. \nDon’t just mention the components of the project you’d like to work on. Include all the nitty-gritty of that – why you’d like to work on them and why it’s useful, what your approaches will be, etc. If you anticipate some edge cases or blockers include them too. This speaks volumes about your maturity. \nKeep your proposal grammatically correct and easily understandable. This helps you communicate your proposal better. Remember that it’s your responsibility to ensure that your proposal was communicated in an expected way. \nSometimes, applications come with incomplete sentences, inconsistency in sentence casing, without punctuations, etc. This is an anti-pattern. Try hard to ensure your proposal doesn’t have those things. This may readily reduce the seriousness of your proposal and the work you put into it. \nInclude a realistic timeline that covers the project deliverables and includes enough time for you and the mentors to communicate effectively. Unexpected things can happen all the time so, it helps to also include some extra time to dedicate to those situations.\n\nSometimes, a project may welcome ideas from the contributors. If you’d like to propose something that’s already not enlisted in a project, be sure to reach out to the project mentor to discuss the feasibility of your idea before working on the proposal."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In this post, I discuss how I used several Google Cloud Platform (GCP) APIs to turn two ideas into small prototypes. It includes my thought process, the problems I ran into while developing the prototypes, and my approach toward tackling them. All the code discussed in the post is available in this repository.\nAs a Machine Learning (ML) Practitioner, I advocate for having an understanding of the underlying principles of the models and other stuff that I use. This understanding has many extents. Sometimes, it involves minimally implementing models, and sometimes it may not involve the from-scratch implementation. When it does not involve the implementation part and when the model is readily available, I prefer to put such models directly to use and get a sense of their broader capabilities.\nWith libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-Learn, realizing this usage has never been easier. As all of these libraries are open-source, you could easily get access to the low-level primitives of their model APIs whenever you’d like. It may require you to have a sufficient amount of experience with the library you’d use. But as a Machine Learning Practitioner, one cannot skip this practice. It’s important to have a good grip over a particular Machine Learning library given the domain of choice (structured tabular dataset, images, texts, audios, for example).\nOn the other hand, APIs that offer ML as a service, allow non-ML folks to incorporate the power of Machine Learning in their applications very easily. This way developers can prototype ideas faster than ever. Some would argue that leaky abstractions can hit sooner than expected and it can be particularly very miserable in Machine Learning. Nonetheless, if you are more on the applied side of things and don’t want to worry about this aspect, that’s perfectly fine.\nI wanted to revisit this idea through the lens of an ML Practitioner. More precisely, I wanted to build a series of short demos utilizing the Cloud ML APIs offered by Google Cloud Platform. The premise here is if I have an idea for an ML project, I wanted to see how quickly I can develop a PoC around it.\n\nThe ideation phase\nLet me quote Emil Wallner from this interview -\n\nIt’s important to collect objective evidence that you can apply machine learning.\n\nWith regard to successful ML practice, this statement couldn’t have been more appropriate. Machine Learning has affected almost every industry in some way, it has changed the way we develop and perceive software. Coming up with an ML application idea that’s not already there or implemented is actually pretty hard.\nSo, I ideated the prototypes drawing inspiration from what is already available. For example, Dale and Kaz of Google built this uber-cool demo that lets you transform a PDF into an audiobook. I really wanted to build something similar but in a more minimal capacity – something that could solely run on a Colab Notebook.\nI decided to revisit some of the GCP ML APIs that I already knew, Vision, Text-to-Speech APIs, for example. As someone that is already working in the field of Computer Vision, I was inclined to do something that involves it. So here are some initial ideas that came to mind after spending a considerable amount of time with the different API documentation available on GCP:\n\nA pipeline that takes a short video clip, detects the entities present in the video and generates an audio clip dictating detected entity labels. This allowed me to spend some time with GCP’s Video Intelligence API.\nA pipeline that takes an arXiv paper and generates an audio clip of the paper abstract. This was inspired by the demo that Dale and Kaz had already built.\n\nNote that if you are already experienced with the Vision and Text-to-Speech APIs then these may seem very trivial.\n\n\nThe mental model\nAfter these ideas, I designed a bunch of visual workflows demonstrating the steps required to realize these ideas along with the right tooling. Here’s an example -\n\nI also like to refer to these workflows as mental models. Additionally, it helps me to figure out the major dependencies and steps that may be required for the work so that I can plan accordingly. I discuss the importance of developing mental models in this blog post.\n(You might have noticed that the above model is a bit different from the first initial idea - I added a logo detection block in there as well.)\nHere is another workflow I developed for the second idea I mentioned above:\n\nThis is slightly different from the initial idea I had. In fact, it does not even incorporate anything related to the Vision API. If I only wanted to deal with arXiv papers, I thought using the arXiv API (I used the arXiv Python library) would be a far more reasonable option here since it already provides important information about an arXiv paper such as its categories, abstract, last updated date, and so on.\nFinally, I wanted to combine the Vision and Text-to-Speech APIs for the second idea I had. In their demos, Dale and Kaz used AutoML Tables to train a model capable of classifying a paragraph of text into the following categories - “body”, “header”, “caption” and “others”. But I wanted to see if I can bypass this additional training step to filter out the abstract block of a paper and perform optical character recognition (OCR) locally. So, I came up with the following workflow -\n\nAs we can see I am using two Python libraries additionally -\n\npdf2image - as the name suggests, it is for converting a PDF file to PNG.\npytesseract - this is for performing OCR locally on an image.\n\nIn the next sections, I’ll discuss the problems I faced while implementing these workflows in code, and how I went about approaching the solutions.\n\n\nBuilding a short video descriptor\nIn the following texts, we will go over the main ingredients that turned out to be important while developing the prototypes. This will include some code along with the motivation to justify their inclusion.\nFor the first two workflows, it was mostly about reading the documentation carefully and figuring out the right APIs to use. GCP provides first-class documentation for these APIs with bindings available in many different languages as you can see in the figure below -\n\nI repurposed these code snippets for the workflows. The Python binding of the Video Intelligence API is simple to use -\nYou first instantiate the client and instruct what all you are interested in performing -\nvideo_client = videointelligence.VideoIntelligenceServiceClient()\nfeatures = [videointelligence.enums.Feature.LABEL_DETECTION]\nIt provides a bag of different features like entity detection, logo recognition, text recognition, object tracking, and so on. Here I am only interested in performing entity detection on a per-segment basis. A user usually specifies segments if they are interested to only analyze a part of their videos. I didn’t specify any segments, and in that case, the Video Intelligence API handles the entire video as a segment. The API also allows you to perform label detection on more granular levels, i.e. on both shot and frame levels.\nAfter the initialization, it was only a matter of a few keystrokes till I made my first video annotation request -\n# Specify the mode in which label detection is to be performed\nmode = videointelligence.enums.LabelDetectionMode.SHOT_AND_FRAME_MODE\nconfig = videointelligence.types.LabelDetectionConfig(label_detection_mode=mode)\ncontext = videointelligence.types.VideoContext(label_detection_config=config)\n \n# Make the request\noperation = video_client.annotate_video(\n    input_uri=gcs_path, features=features, video_context=context)\nHere I am supplying a GCS bucket path of the video I wanted to infer on. Processing the results of the operation is also straightforward -\n# Process video/segment level label annotations\n# Get the first response, since we sent only one video.\nsegment_labels = operation.result.annotation_results[0].segment_label_annotations\nvideo_labels = []\nfor (i, segment_label) in enumerate(segment_labels):\n    print(\"Video label description: {}\".format(segment_label.entity.description))\n    video_labels.append(segment_label.entity.description)\nAfter I got the entity labels on the entire video the next task was to use the Text-to-Speech API to generate an audio clip. For that, I simply followed the official tutorial and reused the code.\nThe logo detection pipeline is almost similar with some very minor changes. In case you want to catch all the details please follow this Colab Notebook.\nI tested the entire workflow on the following video and you can see the outputs right below it -\n\nProcessing video for label annotations:\n\nFinished processing.\nVideo label description: sidewalk\nVideo label description: street\nVideo label description: public space\nVideo label description: pedestrian\n\nProcessing video for logo detection:\n\nFinished processing.\nAs for the audio clip, it got came out pretty nice -\n\n\n\nSpeed-wise the entire pipeline executed pretty quickly.\nI had some previous experience working with videos, so I was able to get an idea of what was going under the hood for the video-related activities but for speech, I plan to get to that probably in the next summer (?)\nA potential extension of this demo could be developed to aid blind people to navigate their ways when they are outside. I developed this demo keeping this mind, hence you won’t see any visual results.\n\n\nDetecting, cropping, and reading an arXiv summary\nI presented with two different workflows for the second idea i.e. get the abstract of an arXiv paper and generate an audio clip of it. The workflow involving the arxiv Python library wasn’t problematic at all, so I am not going to discuss it in detail. You can always check out this fully worked out Colab Notebook in case you are interested.\nThe other workflow is a bit more involved. In there, I wanted to take an arXiv paper in PDF format, use the Vision API to get blocks of texts from it, and then locate the abstract from there like so -\n\nBut that’s not it. I also wanted to perform OCR locally on the text blocks. This essentially allowed me to reduce the number of calls to the Vision API and thereby saving me some $. The final piece of the puzzle was to take the local OCR results and generate an audio clip. If you saw the Text-to-Speech documentation, you probably noticed that it is really not a big deal.\nSo, to realize this workflow here’s what I did (Colab Notebook) -\n\nAs I am only interested in dealing with the abstract of a paper, I first converted the entire PDF-formatted paper to PNG and serialized only the first page. I used the pdf2png library for this.\nNext, I used the Vision API to make a document_text_detection() request for getting the dense text blocks. The code for this is again, very straightforward -\nclient = vision.ImageAnnotatorClient()\nbounds = []\n\nwith io.open(image_file, 'rb') as image_file:\n    content = image_file.read()\n\nimage = types.Image(content=content)\nresponse = client.document_text_detection(image=image)\ndocument = response.full_text_annotation\n\n# Segregate the blocks\nfor page in document.pages:\n    for block in page.blocks:\n        bounds.append(block.bounding_box)\nThen I used the example presented here to draw the bounding boxes on the input image which we saw earlier. I also reused these bounding boxes to segregate different blocks as inferred by the Vision API.\nI am not going to get into the gory details of how I did the segregation. The catch here is for dense text block detection, Vision API returns polygon coordinates and not rectangular coordinates. So, I had to take polygon crops to segregate the different text blocks. (Thanks to this StackOverflow thread.)\nAfter the segregation part, I used pytesseract to perform OCR on the segregated text blocks. In pytesseract it’s literally doable with text = pytesseract.image_to_string(image_block).\nNow, an abstract cannot be just a single character (if the OCR was performed correctly). So I only considered those OCR’d texts where the character length is greater than 1000.\nEven with this kind of thresholding, you’d end up with multiple text blocks where this criterion holds. To counter this, I first sorted the OCR’d text blocks with respect to their character lengths and checked if a text block contained only one or no reference to citations. If this criterion was matched then the text block is returned as the abstract.\nHere’s how I coded it up:\ntexts_sorted = sorted(texts, key=len)\nfor text in texts_sorted:\n    if text.split()[0].isupper() & text.count(\"[\") &lt;= 1:\n        abstract = text\nThe upper case criterion is there to ensure an abstract always starts with an uppercase letter.\nI am aware that these handcrafted rules can get broken for many instances. But I wanted to explore this possibility anyway.\nTo make sure the Text-to-Speech API does not account for any citation I filtered out the raw text to escape them - raw_lines = re.sub(\"[[\\s*\\d*\\,*]*]\", \"\", raw_lines).\n\nAnd that’s it! After a number of trial and error rounds, I was able to get a decent output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal thoughts\nThroughout this post, we went over two different ideas that are good prototype candidates for Machine Learning. We saw how easy it is to see these ideas in actions with different ML APIs. We saw how to make these different APIs work together to solve a given problem. Now, if you are feeling excited enough, you can dive deeper into the different ML tasks we saw: detection and classification, for example. Also note that even if one is using these APIs, it’s important to be able to process the API responses properly for the project at hand.\nI would like to leave you with this amazing resource provided by GCP. It includes detailed solution walkthroughs of real-world problem scenarios across a wide range of different industry verticals. They also show how to make the best use of different GCP services.\nI would like to thank Karl Weinmeister for reviewing this post and for sharing his valuable feedback. Also, thanks to the GDE program for providing the GCP credit support which made these demos possible."

In these cases, the approach is to not just supply a link to your work, but also to first write about any important pointers relevant to the discussion first, and then supply the link to your work to better aid it. Let’s say there’s a discussion going on the topic of “What is Weight Initialization in Neural Nets?” Here’s how I would approach my comment:\n\nA neural net can be viewed as a function with learnable parameters and those parameters are often referred to as weights and biases. Now, while starting the training of neural nets these parameters (typically the weights) are initialized in a number of different ways - sometimes, using constant values like 0’s and 1’s, sometimes with values sampled from some distribution (typically a uniform distribution or normal distribution), sometimes with other sophisticated schemes like Xavier Initialization. The performance of a neural net depends a lot on how its parameters are initialized when it is starting to train. Moreover, if we initialize it randomly for each run, it’s bound to be non-reproducible (almost) and even not-so-performant too. On the other hand, if we initialize it with constant values, it might take way too long to converge. With that, we also eliminate the beauty of randomness which in turn gives a neural net the power to reach covergence quicker using gradient-based learning. We clearly need a better way to initialize it. Careful initialization of weights helps us to train them better. To know more, please follow this article of mine.\n\nWell, that’s it for now. I hope it proves to be useful for you. Please provide any suggestions you may have via the comments. I am thankful to Alessio of FloydHub for sharing these tips with me."

MobileDet is no exception; the authors released their code and pre-trained models in TensorFlow Object Detection (TFOD) API. The model files come in three different variants -\nEach of these variants includes the pre-trained checkpoints, a TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) compatible model graph, a TFLite model file, a configuration file, and a graph proto. The models were pre-trained on the COCO dataset.\nIn this post, I am going to be revisiting the TFLite conversion from the pre-trained model checkpoints along with some of the non-trivial things that come up during the process. It is basically an extension of Khanh LeViet and my findings we shared over this GitHub thread.\nThe code discussed throughout this post is available here as a Colab Notebook."

    "text": "Why yet another post on model conversion?\nFair question. After all, there are so many great examples and tutorials that show how to use the post-training quantization APIs in TFLite to perform the model conversion. MobileDet models in the TFOD API repository were trained in TensorFlow (TF) 1. If you ever wanted to use the latest TFLite converter to do the conversion, that may not be immediately approachable.\nBesides, there are certain caveats to the EdgeTPU and DSP variants. They come in two precision formats - uint8 and float32. The models in uint8 precision were trained using quantization aware training (QAT) while the float32 models were not. During QAT fake quantization nodes get inserted into a model’s computation graph. So, the models trained using QAT usually require some extra care during the TFLite conversion process as we’ll see in a moment.\nIf we wanted to convert a single shot detector (SSD) based model to TFLite then we first need to generate a frozen graph first that is compatible with the TFLite operator set (as per these guides - TF1 and TF2). The TFOD API team provides stock scripts (TF1, TF2) for this. Both of these scripts add optimized postprocessing operations to the model graph. Now, these operations are not yet supported in int8 precision. So, if you ever wanted to convert these pre-trained checkpoints using full integer quantization, what would have been your approach?\nBy now, hopefully, I have been able to convince you that this post is not just about regular model conversion in TFLite. The situations we’ll be going through over the next sections may be helpful for your production TFLite models as well."

    "text": "The hassle-free conversions\nBefore we build our way toward the fun stuff, let’s start with the conversions that won’t cost us a night’s sleep. Conversions based on dynamic-range and float16 quantization would come under this category.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe EdgeTPU and DSP variants of MobileDet are meant to run on the respective hardware accelerators. These accelerators need a model to be in full integer precision. So converting the EdgeTPU and DSP variants with dynamic-range and float16 quantization does not have any practical usage.\n\n\nSo, for dynamic-range and float16 quantization based conversions, we will be using the CPU variant only. This variant is available here as ssd_mobiledet_cpu_coco. Once the model bundle is untar’d we get the following files -\n├── model.ckpt-400000.data-00000-of-00001\n├── model.ckpt-400000.index\n├── model.ckpt-400000.meta\n├── model.tflite\n├── pipeline.config\n├── tflite_graph.pb\n└── tflite_graph.pbtxt\nmodel.ckpt-* files are the pre-trained checkpoints on the COCO dataset. If you train a MobileDet object detection model on your own dataset, you will have your own model checkpoint files. The tflite_graph.pb file is a frozen inference graph that is compatible with the TFLite operator set, which was exported from the pre-trained model checkpoints. model.tflite file is a TFLite model that was converted from the tflite_graph.pb frozen graph.\nIn case if you ever train a MobileDet model on your dataset, here’s how you’d get the TFLite frozen graph file (based on this guide mentioned above) -\n$ PIPELINE_CONFIG=\"checkpoint_name/pipeline.config\"\n$ CKPT_PREFIX=\"checkpoint_name/model.ckpt-400000\"\n$ OUTPUT_DIR=\"tflite_graph\"\n \n$ python models/research/object_detection/export_tflite_ssd_graph.py \\\n   --pipeline_config_path=$PIPELINE_CONFIG \\\n   --trained_checkpoint_prefix=$CKPT_PREFIX \\\n   --output_directory=$OUTPUT_DIR \\\n   --add_postprocessing_op=true\nYou can see a fully worked out example in the Colab Notebook mentioned above. If everything goes well, then you should have the frozen graph file exported in OUTPUT_DIR. Let’s now proceed to the TFLite model conversion part.\nHere’s how the dynamic-range quantization would look like in TensorFlow 2 -\nconverter = tf.compat.v1.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_frozen_graph(\n    graph_def_file=model_to_be_quantized,\n    input_arrays=['normalized_input_image_tensor'],              \n    output_arrays=['TFLite_Detection_PostProcess',\n        'TFLite_Detection_PostProcess:1',\n        'TFLite_Detection_PostProcess:2',\n        'TFLite_Detection_PostProcess:3'],\n   input_shapes={'normalized_input_image_tensor': [1, 320, 320, 3]}\n)\nconverter.optimizations = [tf.lite.Optimize.DEFAULT]\ntflite_model = converter.convert()\nA note about some of the parameters and their values from the above code listing -\n\nmodel_to_be_quantized corresponds to the frozen graph file.\ninput_arrays and input_shapes are set accordingly with respect to the frozen graph file. As we can see in the figure below that these values have been set correctly.\n\noutput_arrays is set according to the instructions provided in this guide. Those operations represent four arrays: detection_boxes, detection_classes, detection_scores, and num_detections, usually a mandate for any object detector out there.\n\nThe rest of the parts in the code listing should be familiar to you if you already know about the typical post-training quantization process in TFLite. For float16 quantization, all the things would remain the same; we just need to add this line before calling convert() - converter.target_spec.supported_types = [tf.float16].\nThe dynamic-range quantized model is 4.3 MB in size and float16 one is 8.2 MB. Later, we will see how fast this model would run on actual mobile devices with and without different accelerators."

    "text": "The trickier TFLite conversions for MobileDet\nIn this section, we will be dealing with the full integer quantization for the three different variants of MobileDet. Full integer quantization is usually more involved than the other quantization formats supported by TFLite.\n\nRepresentative dataset\nOur first step toward doing full integer quantization is preparing a representative dataset. It is required to calibrate the activation ranges so that the quantized model is able to retain the original model performance as much as possible. For the purpose of this post, I sampled 100 images from the COCO training dataset (train2014 split). In my experience, 100 samples as the representative dataset have always been sufficient. I have hosted these images here in case you are interested to use them.\nThe following code listing denotes a generator function that produces a preprocessed image to the TFLite converter -\nrep_ds = tf.data.Dataset.list_files(\"train_samples/*.jpg\")\nHEIGHT, WIDTH = 320, 320\n \ndef representative_dataset_gen():\n   for image_path in rep_ds:\n       img = tf.io.read_file(image_path)\n       img = tf.io.decode_image(img, channels=3)\n       img = tf.image.convert_image_dtype(img, tf.float32)\n       resized_img = tf.image.resize(img, (HEIGHT, WIDTH))\n       resized_img = resized_img[tf.newaxis, :]\n       yield [resized_img]\nNote that these preprocessing steps should be in sync with the actual preprocessing steps that would apply before running inference with your TFLite model. In case if you are interested to know about more complex representative dataset generators you may find this notebook useful.\nAlso, note that dynamic-range and float16 quantization of the EdgeTPU and DSP variants don’t have much of practical usage. The next section is going to be solely about full integer quantization of these different variants and the nitty-gritty to take into consideration for the conversion process.\n\n\nDealing with fake quantization nodes during conversion\nThe figure below represents a portion of the uint8 EdgeTPU model computation graph. The nodes highlighted in red are inserted by the QAT mechanism. You would notice the same kind of nodes in the uint8 DSP model computation graph as well.\n\nNow, these nodes have some important implications that we need to consider during the conversion process -\n\nDuring QAT the activation ranges are already approximated i.e. QAT resembles post-training quantization during training and adjusts the activation ranges accordingly. So, we don’t need to provide a representative dataset for a full integer quantization based conversion.\nThese fake nodes are generally in integer precision. So, setting an optimization option (converter.optimizations) might lead to inconsistencies.\nIn order to convert the uint8 models with full integer quantization, we need to set the input and output data type of the TFLite models to integer precision (typically uint8 or int8). As per this documentation, we also need to specify the quantized_input_stats parameter during the conversion process. This is needed in order for the converted TFLite model to map the quantized input values to real values. More details are available here.\n\nSo, how do we realize all of these in code?\nconverter = tf.compat.v1.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_frozen_graph(\n   graph_def_file=model_to_be_quantized,\n   input_arrays=['normalized_input_image_tensor'],\n   output_arrays=['TFLite_Detection_PostProcess',\n       'TFLite_Detection_PostProcess:1',\n       'TFLite_Detection_PostProcess:2',\n       'TFLite_Detection_PostProcess:3'],\n   input_shapes={'normalized_input_image_tensor': [1, 320, 320, 3]}\n)\nconverter.inference_input_type = tf.uint8\nconverter.quantized_input_stats = {\"normalized_input_image_tensor\": (128, 128)}\ntflite_model = converter.convert()\nIf you’re thinking this does not look all that gory compared to the above code listing - it does not have to be! The tooling should help you do these things seamlessly. But catching these details during your project development may not be trivial. Note that we don’t specify converter.inference_output_type. Hold your breath, we will come to this in a moment.\nAfter successful execution, we get two full integer quantized models - EdgeTPU one is 4.2 MB and the DSP one is 7.0 MB.\n\n\nInteger quantization for CPU variants and float32 precision models\nThe variants that don’t contain fake quantization nodes (CPU and all the models in float32 precision) have a relatively simpler conversion process. Recollect that the EdgeTPU and DSP variants come in two different precisions - uint8 and float32. For example, here’s how it would be for the float32 precision models -\nconverter.representative_dataset = representative_dataset_gen\nconverter.inference_input_type = tf.uint8\nconverter.optimizations = [tf.lite.Optimize.DEFAULT]\nNote that we are specifying a representative dataset here because the float32 precision models weren’t trained using QAT. For the CPU variant model, the lines of code would slightly change -\nconverter.inference_input_type = tf.uint8\nconverter.quantized_input_stats = {\"normalized_input_image_tensor\": (128, 128)}\nconverter.optimizations = [tf.lite.Optimize.DEFAULT]\nHonestly, I found this configuration by trial and error. I observed that if I specify a representative dataset then it hurts the predictions of the converted model. Also, I found out that specifying converter.quantized_input_stats helped improve the predictions of the converted model.\nWe don’t specify converter.inference_output_type in this case as well. Let’s get to it now.\n\n\nDealing with non-integer postprocessing ops during conversion\nRemember that frozen graph exporter scripts provided by the TFOD API team add optimized postprocessing operations to the graph. These operations are not supported in integer precision yet. So, even if you wanted to specify converter.inference_output_type as tf.uint8 you’ll likely get the following error -\nRuntimeError: Unsupported output type UINT8 for output tensor 'TFLite_Detection_PostProcess' of type FLOAT32.\nThis is why we did not set the converter.inference_output_type parameter.\nThis should resolve all the problems you may run into if you ever wanted to convert the MobileDet models offered by the TFOD API team. In the last two sections, we’ll see these converted models in action and how fast they can perform on respective hardware accelerators."

I experimented with different threshold values for filtering out the weak predictions and a threshold of 0.3 yielded the best results. These results are pretty consistent across the several different models we talked about.\nA major point to note here for the EdgeTPU and DSP variants, their converted counterparts would be much slower on Colab since they were specifically optimized for different hardware accelerators.\nYou are encouraged to play with the different converted models using the Colab Notebook mentioned above and see these results for yourself."

But a more practical approach to this would be to first benchmark these models on a set of devices using the TFLite Benchmark Tool and then decide accordingly.\nThe following table provides a comprehensive summary of the important statistics about the runtime of different TFLite MobileDet models. These results were generated using the TFLite Benchmark Tool mentioned above.\n\n\n* Device used - Pixel 4 (Inference timings are reported in milliseconds) ** As reported here\n\nWe can see that with the proper hardware accelerators, the DSP EdgeTPU variants can really shine. For the CPU variant, on a GPU accelerated runtime the float16 quantized TFLite model can bring in additional speed boosts.\nA catch here is Pixel devices don’t allow third-party applications to use the Hexagon DSP therefore even if we instruct the Benchmark Tool to make use of that the model would fall back to the CPU for execution. This is why for fair benchmarking results for the DSP variants we should consider running the Benchmark Tool on a device (such as Samsung Galaxy S9+) that has Hexagon DSP and also allows third-party applications to use it.\n\n\n* Device used - Samsung Galaxy S9+ (Inference timings are reported in milliseconds)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTo train a custom MobileDet-based object detector you can refer to these notebooks."

    "text": "Jupyter Notebooks are a great way to present your code offering a good level of interactivity, transparency, and reproducibility. However, operating with a Jupyter Notebook environment can get very challenging if you are working your way through large-scale training workflows as is common in deep learning.\nIf you are conducting large-scale training it is likely that you are using a powerful remote machine via SSH access. So, even if you are not using Jupyter Notebooks, problems like SSH pipe breakage, network teardown, etc. can easily occur. Consider using a powerful virtual machine on Cloud as your remote. The problem gets far worse when there’s a connection loss but you somehow forget to turn off that virtual machine to stop consuming its resources. You get billed for practically nothing when the breakdown happens until and unless you have set up some amount of alerts and fault tolerance.\nTo resolve these kinds of problems, we would want to have the following things in the pipeline:\n\nA training workflow that is fully managed by a secure and reliable service with high availability.\nThe service should automatically provision and de-provision the resources we would ask it to configure allowing us to only get charged for what’s been truly consumed.\nThe service should also be very flexible. It must not introduce too much technical debt into our existing pipelines.\n\nIn this post, we are going to consider all of these factors and will implement them using a service called AI Platform (provided by GCP) and Docker. We will use TensorFlow and Keras to handle distributed training to develop an image classification model capable of classifying cats and dogs. Apart from deep learning-related knowledge, a bit of familiarity would be needed to fully understand this post.\nAll the code presented throughout the post can be found here. We won’t be covering the entire codebase, instead, we will focus on the most important bits.\nIf you are like me, who have lost sleep over the very thought of the aforementioned problem, you will likely find this tutorial a good starting point to get around it.\n\nEnvironment setup\nYou will need to have Docker, command-line GCP (Google Cloud Platform) tools like gcloud, and TensorFlow (2.x) installed if you are on a local machine. But if you have a billing-enabled GCP project it’s possible to get started without any significant setup.\nWe will use a cheap AI Platform Notebook instance as our staging machine which we will use to build our custom Docker image, push it to Google Container Registry (GCR), and submit a training job to AI Platform. Additionally, we will use this instance to create TensorFlow Records (TFRecords) from the original dataset (Cats vs. Dogs in this case) and upload them to a GCS Bucket. AI Platform notebooks come pre-configured with many useful Python libraries, Linux packages like docker, and also the command-line GCP tools like gcloud.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nI used an n1-standard-4 instance with TensorFlow 2.4 as the base image which costs $0.141 hourly.\n\n\n\n\nNotes on the task, data pipeline, and training\nTask\nAs mentioned earlier, we will be training an image classification model on the Cats vs. Dogs dataset which is a moderate-sized dataset. The learning problem is a binary classification task.\nData pipeline\nFor setting up our data pipeline, we will first create shards of TFRecords from the original dataset. Each of the shards will contain batches of preprocessed images and their labels. This has an advantage. When we would load these shards back for training, we won’t need to do any preprocessing giving us a slight performance boost. Figure 1 demonstrates our TFRecords’ creation workflow.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Schematics of our TFRecord’s creation process.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Schematics of our TFRecord’s creation process.\n\nAs you might have already noticed that we have also thrown in another component in the mix – a GCS Bucket. We would need to store our data on a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) Bucket since the training code won’t be executed locally. We could have used other bucket services (like AWS S3) here but TensorFlow has very unified integrations with GCS Buckets, hence. We will be using the same GCS Bucket to store our trained model and also TensorBoard logs. The total cost to store all of these will be about $1.20.\nYou are welcome to check out the corresponding code here. In order to streamline the TFRecords’ creation and upload process we will make use of a little shell script:\necho \"Uploading TFRecords to Storage Bucket...\"\necho gs://${BUCKET_NAME}\n\npython ../trainer/create_tfrecords.py\n\ngsutil -m cp -r train_tfr gs://${BUCKET_NAME}\ngsutil -m cp -r validation_tfr gs://${BUCKET_NAME}\n\ngsutil ls -lh gs://${BUCKET_NAME}\nAfter creating the TFRecords we simply copy them over to a previously created GCS Bucket. You can create one by executing the following: gsutil mb ${BUCKET_NAME}.\nTraining\nAs for the training pipeline, we will follow the steps below: - Load the TFRecords from GCS using CPU in a parallelized way using tf.data.Dataset.map() and feed batches of data to our model. For performance, we will also prefetch several future batches of data so that our model does not have to wait for the data to consume. Our data loader is present here in this script. - We will be using a pre-trained model to unleash the power of transfer learning. In particular, we will be using the DenseNet121 model that is available inside tf.keras.applications. - We will be training our model inside the tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy scope for distributed training. This strategy is applicable when we have a single host containing multiple GPUs. We will also be using mixed-precision training to speed up the process. The code for realizing this is here.\nThe training will take place on a remote machine fully managed by AI Platform.\nSo far, we have discussed the utilities for creating TFRecords, loading them, and building and training our model. Here’s how the code is structured in the GitHub repository mentioned at the beginning of the post:\n├── Dockerfile\n├── README.md\n├── config.yaml\n├── scripts\n│   ├── train_cloud.sh\n│   ├── train_local.sh\n│   └── upload_tfr.sh\n└── trainer\n    ├── config.py\n    ├── create_tfrecords.py\n    ├── data_loader.py\n    ├── model_training.py\n    ├── model_utils.py\n    ├── task.py\n    └── tfr_utils.py\nNext, we will be reviewing how Docker fits into all these. From there on, we will have all the recipes set up to kickstart model training.\n\n\nFitting in Docker\nTo submit custom training jobs to AI Platform, we need to package our code inside a Docker image. So, let’s start with that.\nTo build a Docker image, we first need to define a Dockerfile specifying how it should itself up. Google Container Registry (GCR) provides CUDA-configured TensorFlow containers that we can use to build custom ones. In our case, we extend one such container. Our Dockerfile looks like so:\n# Use an existing CUDA-configured TensorFlow container\nFROM gcr.io/deeplearning-platform-release/tf2-gpu.2-4\nWORKDIR /root\n\n# Update TensorFlow to the latest version (2.4.1 at the\n# time of writing).\nRUN pip install -U tensorflow\n\n# Copies the trainer code to the docker image.\nCOPY trainer/config.py ./trainer/config.py\nCOPY trainer/data_loader.py ./trainer/data_loader.py\nCOPY trainer/model_utils.py ./trainer/model_utils.py\nCOPY trainer/model_training.py ./trainer/model_training.py\nCOPY trainer/task.py ./trainer/task.py\n\n# Set up the entry point to invoke the trainer.\nENTRYPOINT [\"python\"]\nCMD [\"trainer/task.py\"]\nAfter we have defined the Dockerfile, we can proceed to build it and do a round of model training by locally running it.\n\n\nBuilding and locally running our container\nWe will be using GCR to manage the lifecycle of our container. To build a Docker container, one must provide a correct Image URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) and it depends on the platform you are using for managing your container. In our case, that is GCR.\nFor GCR, the format of the image goes like the following: gcr.io/${PROJECT_ID}/${IMAGE_REPO_NAME}:${IMAGE_TAG}, where PROJECT_ID is the ID of your GCP project and IMAGE_REPO_NAME and IMAGE_TAG are identifiers.\nWe then build our image and locally run it:\n$ docker build -f Dockerfile -t ${IMAGE_URI} ./\n$ docker run ${IMAGE_URI} \\\n    trainer/task.py --bucket ${BUCKET_NAME} \\\n    --train-pattern ${TRAIN_FILES} \\\n    --valid-pattern ${VALIDATION_FILES}\nTo make the process cleaner, we can create a shell script and put all the instructions inside it. You can follow this one to get an idea.\nThe first time it’s run, it’s going to take a while. But after that, all the consequent runs will use the cached resources to speed up the build. The local Docker daemon (dockerd) will first read our Dockerfile and after getting to the entry point, it will parse all the command-line arguments we provided to task.py. task.py just takes all the command-line arguments and starts the model training. TRAIN_FILES and VALIDATION_FILES are patterns to the TFRecords residing inside a GCS Bucket and they look like so -\nTRAIN_FILES=gs://${BUCKET_NAME}/train_tfr/*.tfrec\nVALIDATION_FILES=gs://${BUCKET_NAME}/validation_tfr/*.tfrec\nIf everything goes well, then, after a while, you should be able to see that our model has started training:\n\n\nFigure 2: Docker build.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Local training logs.\n\nThe local Docker run is a way for us to ensure our code is running fine without any hiccups. So, it’s advisable to stop the local run after you have ensured the model is able to start training. With this, we are now ready to push our custom Docker image to GCR, and submit a training job to AI Platform.\n\n\nSubmitting a training job\nFor this step, we need to add two more lines of code: * After building our Docker image, we need to push it to GCR so that AI Platform can pull it to run model training. * Submit a training job to AI Platform.\nSo, let’s put these pieces together:\n# Build and push the docker image\n$ docker build -f Dockerfile -t ${IMAGE_URI} ./\n$ docker push ${IMAGE_URI}\n\n# Submit job\n$ gcloud ai-platform jobs submit training ${JOB_NAME} \\\n    --region ${REGION} \\\n    --master-image-uri ${IMAGE_URI} \\\n    --config ./config.yaml \\\n    -- \\\n    trainer/task.py --bucket ${BUCKET_NAME} \\\n    --train-pattern ${TRAIN_FILES} \\\n    --valid-pattern ${VALIDATION_FILES}\nReviewing what’s going on with the gcloud command, we have:\n\nregion, that informs AI Platform about the region to be used for the training process. This very region is also going to be used to provision resources such as GPUs. If GPUs are to be used then it’s important to pass a region that has that support. You can know the regions that have this support from here.\nmaster-image-uri is the URI of our custom Docker image.\nVia config, we provide a specification of the kind of machine we want to use for training. This specification is provided using a YAML file and ours looks like so:\ntrainingInput:\n  scaleTier: CUSTOM\n  # Configure a master worker with 2 V100 GPUs\n  masterType: n1-standard-8 # Specify the base machine type\n  masterConfig:\n    acceleratorConfig:\n      count: 2\n      type: NVIDIA_TESLA_V100\nThe advantage of using specifications like this lies in the flexibility it provides. The gcloud ai-platform jobs submit training command has a scale-tier option through which we can pass a pre-defined machine configuration. But let’s say we want to train using multiple machines - 1 master, 3 workers, and 3 parameter servers each having different GPU and CPU configurations. The pre-defined values won’t cut here and this is where we can take the advantage of custom specifications. You can check here to know the different machine types and configurations that can be provided to AI Platform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWe are using V100 GPUs because they come with Tensor cores and that is a must-have to take the advantage of mixed-precision training. We could have used other GPUs like T4, A100 as well that fit this criterion.\n\n\n\nWe have already discussed the part that follows config so we will not be reviewing that here. If the job submission is successful you should see an entry for it on the GCP console:\n\n\nFigure 4: AI Platform training job list.\n\nOn the extreme right, you would notice an option called View Logs that lets us monitor our training. It’s incredibly useful to have all of your training logs stored somewhere safe without making any effort. Logging for an AI Platform training job is managed by Cloud Logging. Here’s how mine looks like:\n\n\nFigure 5: Training logs. Notice the neat search filter query.\n\nAfter training is complete, we can verify if all the necessary artifacts were stored inside our GCS Bucket:\n\n\nFigure 6: SavedModel file and TensorBoard logs.\n\nIn our training script, we had set up the TensorBoard callback to keep track of the training progress. You can check one such log here online on tensorboard.dev. Inspecting into it, we can see that our model’s been trained well, as the validation accuracy has stabilized:\n\n\nFigure 7: Accuracy plot.\n\nAs an effective practitioner, It’s important to be aware of the costs and ensure maximization of resource utilization. Now that we were able to successfully complete our model training, let’s discuss these aspects in the next and final section of the post.\n\n\nDelving deep into training costs and resource utilization\nAI Platform provides a number of useful metrics for the training jobs. Each job has a separate dashboard that makes it super easy to keep track of its statistics such as total training time, average resource utilization, etc.\nFirst, we have high-level information about the job:\n\n\nFigure 8: High-level information about a training job.\n\nWe can see that the job takes about 22 minutes to complete, and this includes the provisioning of resources, completing the model training, and de-provisioning the resources. We then see the total ML units consumed to run our job. The cost for this translates to:\n1.79 (Consumed ML units) \\(\\times\\) USD 0.49 = USD 0.8771\nYou can refer to this document that details the cost calculation scheme. GCP also provides a handy estimated cost calculator that you can find here.\nSo far our costs are: USD 0.141 (AI Platform Notebook) + USD 1.20 (GCS) + USD 0.8771 (training job) = USD 2.2181. Let’s compare this to an AI Platform Notebook instance equipped with the similar configurations as the one we used for training:\n\n\nFigure 9: Cost for an AI Platform Notebook with 2 V100 GPUs with n1-standard-8.\n\nComing to CPU utilization, we have some room for improvement it seems:\n\n\nFigure 10: CPU utilization of our training resources.\n\nThe overall GPU utilization has a few spikes which might need some more inspections in the future:\n\n\nFigure 11: GPU utilization of our training resources.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nWe have covered quite a lot of ground in this post. I hope by now you have an idea of how to combine tools like Docker, AI Platform to manage your large-scale training workflows in a more cost-effective and scalable way. As a next step, you could take the trained model from AI Platform and deploy the model using it. AI Platform predict jobs make it easier to expose models via REST API-like services that are fully managed by AI Platform offering things like autoscaling, authorization, monitoring, etc. If you’d like to try it out yourself, I encourage you to check out the code of this post on GitHub. You are also welcome to checkout TensorFlow Cloud that provides a set of tools making it easier to perform large-scale training with GCP.\n\n\nAcknowledgements\nI am thankful to Karl Weinmeister for his comments on the initial draft of this post. Also, thanks to the ML-GDE program for providing generous GCP support without which I couldn’t have executed the experiments."

    "title": "Publishing ConvNeXt Models on TensorFlow Hub",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I recently added 15 different variants of the ConvNeXt architecture to TensorFlow Hub (TF-Hub). This post is a reflection of what had to be done to get to that point. First, we’ll discuss the implementation of ConvNeXt in Keras and how the original pre-trained parameters were ported into these models. We’ll then talk about TF-Hub’s ConvNeXt collection and what it offers.\nI hope this post is useful for anyone willing to contribute models to TF-Hub as doing it the right way can be a good amount of work.\n\nAbout ConvNeXt\nConvNeXt models were proposed by Liu et al. in A ConvNet for the 2020s. ConvNeXt models are composed of standard layers such as depthwise convolutions, layer normalization, etc., and use standard network topologies. They don’t use self-attention or any hybrid approaches, unlike the recent architectures such as Vision Transformers, CoAtNet, etc. The authors start with a base architecture and gradually refine it to match some of the design choices of Swin Transformers. In the process, they developed a family of models named ConvNeXt achieving performance on the ImageNet-1k dataset with efficiency. For details, check out the original paper.\n\n\nFigure 1: ConvNeXt performance (source: original paper).\n\n\n\nImplementation and weight porting\nThe ConvNeXt models are fairly easy to implement especially with the official PyTorch codebase available for reference. As mentioned before, these models can be implemented using the standard components provided in most of the major deep learning frameworks such as JAX, PyTorch, and TensorFlow.\nConvNeXt models use the following block structure with layer scaling as introduced in Going deeper with image transformers by Touvron et al.\n\n\nFigure 2: ConvNeXt block (source: original paper).\n\nThe skip connection is controlled with Stochastic Depth to induce regularization during training. Different ConvNeXt variants correspond to different depths along with different channels used in each of the stages. For example, the “tiny” variant uses the following setup:\ndepths = [3, 3, 9, 3]\ndims = [96, 192, 384, 768]\nIf you plan to populate the implemented models with the original parameters then it helps to align the architecture implementation with the official one as much as possible. Since I went with this approach I tried closely following the official implementation. My final implementation is available in this script. Note that, it does not yet include the isotropic ConvNeXt models.\nComing to the weight porting part, this is usually the most interesting part because there’s no standard recipe that’d work for all the models. You’ll need to think about how to best align the original model parameters with your implementation.\nA ConvNeXt model is divided into three main parts: (1) stem which directly operates on the input image, (2) downsample blocks that reduce the resolution of feature maps as the network progresses, and (3) stages that apply the ConvNeXt blocks shown above. This is why I organized my weight porting script such that it has a correspondence between these different parts with the original parameters. Here is an example:\nfor layer in stem_block.layers:\n    if isinstance(layer, tf.keras.layers.Conv2D):\n        layer.kernel.assign(\n            tf.Variable(param_list[0].numpy().transpose(2, 3, 1, 0))\n        )\n        layer.bias.assign(tf.Variable(param_list[1].numpy()))\n    elif isinstance(layer, tf.keras.layers.LayerNormalization):\n        layer.gamma.assign(tf.Variable(param_list[2].numpy()))\n        layer.beta.assign(tf.Variable(param_list[3].numpy()))\nThe most difficult bit was figuring out how to properly populate the weights of the convolutional layers in TensorFlow from PyTorch. In an earlier implementation, I was simply using transpose(). The resulting models were giving poorer performance than expected. Vasudev helped me figure out the correct transposition of the weight axes and the models were then coming out as expected. More about the evaluation of these models in a moment.\nOnce the weights were ported successfully, the next task was to verify if the outputs of the intermediate layers matched with their original counterparts. One minor detail to note here is that the outputs of layers are not the same as their parameters. So, even if you check if the parameters of your implemented model and the original model are matching, their outputs could still mismatch. This mainly happens because of mismatches between the layer configurations of your model and the original one.\nThe final model conversion script is available here.\n\n\nEvaluation of the models\nTo be more certain, it’s also important to check the evaluation metrics of the converted models on the datasets used during training. In this case, we need to use the top-1 accuracy of the models on the ImageNet-1k dataset (validation set).\nTo set up this evaluation, I developed this notebook where I closely followed the preprocessing used in the official codebase for inference. The following table reflects the top-1 accuracies of the converted models along with the original scores reported here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\n\n\nOriginal acc@1\n\n\nKeras acc@1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconvnext_tiny_1k_224\n\n\n82.1\n\n\n81.312\n\n\n\n\nconvnext_small_1k_224\n\n\n83.1\n\n\n82.392\n\n\n\n\nconvnext_base_1k_224\n\n\n83.8\n\n\n83.28\n\n\n\n\nconvnext_base_1k_384\n\n\n85.1\n\n\n84.876\n\n\n\n\nconvnext_large_1k_224\n\n\n84.3\n\n\n83.844\n\n\n\n\nconvnext_large_1k_384\n\n\n85.5\n\n\n85.376\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconvnext_base_21k_1k_224\n\n\n85.8\n\n\n85.364\n\n\n\n\nconvnext_base_21k_1k_384\n\n\n86.8\n\n\n86.79\n\n\n\n\nconvnext_large_21k_1k_224\n\n\n86.6\n\n\n86.36\n\n\n\n\nconvnext_large_21k_1k_384\n\n\n87.5\n\n\n87.504\n\n\n\n\nconvnext_xlarge_21k_1k_224\n\n\n87.0\n\n\n86.732\n\n\n\n\nconvnext_xlarge_21k_1k_384\n\n\n87.8\n\n\n87.68\n\n\n\n\n\nKeras acc@1 refers to the scores of my implementation. Differences in the results are primarily because of the differences in the library implementations, especially how image resizing is implemented in PyTorch and TensorFlow. My evaluation logs are available at this URL. I’d like to thank Gus from the TF-Hub team for the productive discussions during this phase.\n\n\nPublishing on TF-Hub\nWith the models converted as expected, I was now tasked with publishing them on TF-Hub. These models can be categorized into two different variants: (1) off-the-shelf classifiers and (2) feature extractors used for downstream tasks. This means that the 15 model variants that I had converted would actually amount to 30 models.\nWhenever I publish models on TF-Hub, I try to accompany each model with the following:\n\nDocumentation that includes references of the models, how it was exported, etc.\nColab Notebook showing the model usage.\n\nDoing these things (especially the documentation part) for 30 models can be quite cumbersome. Willi from the TF-Hub team supported me in automatically generating documentation for 30 models. The script is available here. This script was basically generated from a documentation template and can be used for generating documentation when publishing more than one model. Additionally, I worked on a script that can archive the TensorFlow SavedModels in a way accepted by TF-Hub.\nI hope these scripts will be beneficial for anyone planning to contribute models to TF-Hub.\nAs of today, all 30 models are available on TF-Hub. They come with Colab Notebooks and documentation so that it’s easier to get started. Moreover, these TF-Hub models are not black-box SavedModels. You can load them as tf.keras.Model objects for further inspection. Here’s an example:\nmodel_gcs_path = \"gs://tfhub-modules/sayakpaul/convnext_tiny_1k_224/1/uncompressed\"\nmodel = tf.keras.models.load_model(model_gcs_path)\nprint(model.summary(expand_nested=True))\n\n\nWrapping up\nThat’s it for the post. We discussed a standard workflow that I use to publish models on TF-Hub and the difficulties that can arise during the process. I hope you’ve found it to be worthy of your time and thank you for reading!\n\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nVasudev for helping with transposition bug\nGus for fruitful discussions\nWilli for helping with publishing\nML-GDE program for providing Google Cloud Platform credits"
